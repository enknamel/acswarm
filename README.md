# acswarm

[![CI](https://github.com/enknamel/acswarm/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/enknamel/acswarm/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A from-scratch Rust reimplementation of the Asheron's Call client, built to
play against the [ACE](https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE) server emulator.

Status: pre-release (0.0.x), playable against ACE. The DAT reader is
verified byte-for-byte against ACE; `acswarm` renders the world
(landblocks, scenery, interiors, models, particles), logs in and plays a
character by hand with a chat overlay, and lets characters play on their
own (autoplay: fighting, looting, buffing, town runs, a fellowship that
follows its leader), many sessions per process, windowed or `--headless`.
See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the crate map, data flow and build
commands, [`docs/plugins.md`](docs/plugins.md) for writing a plugin,
[`docs/multi-session.md`](docs/multi-session.md) for running several
clients, [`docs/game/mechanics.md`](docs/game/mechanics.md) for the game
rules the client must follow (magic, combat, advancement, death, trade),
`docs/subsystems/` for the format and protocol specs, and
`reference/README.md` for how the reverse-engineering material is
regenerated.

cargo run --release -p acswarm -- --chargen aluvian,m,3,0,0,0,0.5 --camera 0,0.8,1.62,180,0 --screenshot face.png
```

`--chargen` dresses the race's Setup (or `--model`) the way the server would
for a freshly created character: hair style (option index; 0 is bald for
human males), eyes/nose/mouth strips and skin shade (0..1), with the
optional hair and eye colour indices. `--camera x,y,z,yaw_deg,pitch_deg`
works with any `--screenshot`; the model stands at the origin facing -Y.

Viewer controls: right-drag to look, WASD to move, Q/E down/up, Shift to
boost, Escape to quit.

With several sessions in one process, the `party` plugin coordinates them
from the chat box: `/leader` makes the current session the leader (`/leader
N` picks another), `/follow` makes every other session run after it whenever
it is more than 3 m away (around corners too: a blocked line plans a route
on the landblock's walkable grid, see `ac_scene::nav`), `/assist` makes them attack whatever the leader
attacks (entering melee mode first), and `/lootall` makes each session open
the corpse of its last kill and take everything in it; each switch takes
`on`/`off` or toggles. `/party` prints the state, and the Party window lists
every session (name, level, health, distance to the leader, target) with
Switch and Lead buttons. The leader's target is broadcast on the bus as
`party.target`; the leader's index is the blackboard value `party.leader`.
Sessions in different processes coordinate the same way when each is
started with `--bus`: the first process hosts a loopback hub, the others
join it, and posts and blackboard values flow between them (see
[docs/multi-session.md](docs/multi-session.md)). A fleet needs no
command line at all: the Fleet panel (menu → Fleet → Sessions) takes
follower accounts, starts them as extra sessions of the client you play,
creates their characters when the account has none, puts them on your
team as followers, and remembers them for the next launch ("Starting a
fleet from the client" in the same document). The Items window (menu →
Items (all characters), or the Fleet panel's **items** button) searches
every character's inventory on every account at once, the ones online
and the ones not, with the inventory's own search language ("Items
across characters" there).

Against a local ACE (`tools/ace/up.sh` starts one in Docker):

```
# headless: log in, create the character if the account lacks it, enter the world, print chat
cargo run --release -p acswarm -- --headless --connect 127.0.0.1 --client myaccount:mypassword --create Reborn --log-chat
# admin accounts can teleport: --say "@telepoi holtburg"
# play: third-person view, WASD walks the character, right-drag turns, Shift walks
# slowly, Enter opens the chat box (server commands start with @; the log
# has tabs for Say, Combat, Magic, Channels and System with unread counts,
# timestamps, a draggable top edge, and clicking a speaker's name starts a
# tell), left click
# selects and appraises an object (Z opens the appraisal window, which
# then follows whatever you assess; the summary always goes to the chat),
# double-click uses it (doors, NPCs), picks
# it up (ground items) or puts it on / takes it off (in the inventory panel,
# toggled with I, which groups items by pack, shows burden and pack slots,
# searches by name, spell, material or stats such as dmg>10, al>=100,
# type:armor, spell:blood, wielded, sorts by value/burden/damage/armor and
# shows an item's stats on hover; right-click an item for its menu, where
# "Use on..." then a click on another item combines the two (single-step
# crafting: a carving knife on a pumpkin, an oil on a weapon, a mana stone
# on an item), so they need not be next to each other; "Appraise all" fetches the stats of every
# item; V toggles the nameplates over creatures, players and portals
# (names fade with distance, a health bar under anything hurt or targeted);
# M opens the map: the world map of Dereth with the towns, or the
# current landblock (a dungeon's floor plan indoors) with everything the
# server has sent as dots and a searchable list of it (click selects);
# searching also finds towns, lifestones, shops and NPCs anywhere in the
# world and a click travels to them; double-click a spot on the world map,
# or type a town name, to travel there, using portals when they are quicker; K shows the character sheet with Raise buttons that spend
# unassigned XP on attributes, vitals and skills and Train buttons that
# spend skill credits; panels can be dragged anywhere and where you put
# them, which ones are open and what you searched for are remembered in
# ~/.config/acswarm/ui.json (X has "Reset window layout"); drag an item from the inventory onto a side pack or the
# Pack header to move it (a stack onto another of its kind merges them;
# right-click a stack for the split slider), onto the target bar or an NPC/player in the world
# Double-click picks a loose item up and uses anything else; with an
# object selected, R uses it where it is (read a book or sign on the
# ground, open a chest) and G picks it up, retail's separate actions.
# Using a sign, plaque or book (in the world or in the pack) opens the
# book window with its pages. The status line shows the map coordinates
# (42.1N, 33.6E) outdoors.
# (clicking anything in the world or a single click on an item in the
# pack, a container, a vendor's list or the trade window selects and
# appraises it: the appraisal window shows its value, damage, armor,
# spells and requirements)
# to hand it over (always a gift; to use a kit, stone or key on someone,
# select them and use the item), onto an open chest to store it, or onto empty ground to
# drop it, onto a chest, house hook or storage chest to put it there;
# K shows the skills panel, P the spellbook, B the spell bar
# (1..9 cast its spells, Insert/PageUp cycle tabs, Delete/PageDown spells),
# O the components panel, U the buffs, F the fellowship, L the allegiance
# (swear to the selected player, break, name it; /v /p /m /c chat to
# vassals, patron, monarch, co-vassals; /g /trade /lfg /rp /a for the
# General, Trade, LFG, Roleplay and allegiance rooms; *wave*, *bow*,
# *cheer* and some seventy other emotes typed between asterisks, or as
# /wave, animate and say the line), H housing (your house, guests,
# recall; use a house sign to see its price and buy it), N the social
# panel (your title, friends with who is online, squelches), J the rules
# for playing on its own (heal and break off at a health you set, keep
# buffs up, fight what you name and skip what you do not, take the loot
# that matches an inventory search, each search counting the carried items
# it would take; a line says what it is doing), X the character
# options (every panel can be dragged anywhere by its empty space; the
# options panel's "Reset window layout" puts them all back); server
# questions such as a fellowship invitation or an oath pop up with Yes/No;
# double-click the Ust to open the salvage window, drag a salvage bag onto
# an item in the pack to tinker it). C toggles combat in the stance of
# the wielded weapon (a bow, crossbow or atlatl with ammunition in the
# ammo slot gives missile mode; anything else melee):
# the combat bar then shows the attack height and the power/accuracy
# slider (Insert/PageUp step power, Delete/PageDown height) and auto-repeat;
# double-click another player (in peace mode) to open a secure trade: drag
# items into your offer, Accept on both sides swaps them;
# double-click a creature to attack it until it dies; double-click its corpse
# to loot (Take all / Close). Hold Space to charge a jump (a green bar
# under the vitals; a second fills it) and release to leap; stamina caps
# the power. Sounds play unless --mute.
# Character select and creation: without --character the window shows the
# account's characters after login (Up/Down highlight, Enter enters; Delete
# asks first and the server keeps the character for a while with Restore
# beside it; New character opens the creation screen). Creation walks five
# panes (Left/Right or PageUp/PageDown: heritage and sex, appearance with a
# turntable preview of the model, right-drag turns it, template and
# attributes, skills with the credits left, name and starting town) and
# Create sends it when the rules pass; Escape returns to the list.
# Offline: --demo-select and --demo-create show both screens with no server
# (--press ArrowRight steps the creation panes; add --screenshot out.png).
# Chat lines starting with / go to the plugins first (/help lists them),
# then to the game's own commands (/lifestone, /die, /house, /tell Name,
# text, /emote, /afk), and anything else to the server as @command
# (/acehelp lists those).
cargo run --release -p acswarm -- --connect 127.0.0.1 -a myaccount -v mypassword
# several characters in one window: --client ACCOUNT:PASSWORD[:CHARACTER]
# per extra session; Tab (or /switch N) picks the one shown and steered
cargo run --release -p acswarm -- --connect 127.0.0.1 -a alice -v pw1 --client bob:pw2:Bob
```

## Launcher

`aclauncher` is a small desktop launch manager: a list of servers on the
left, the accounts on the selected server in the middle (each with an
optional character name and Launch / Launch headless / Remove buttons, plus
Launch all), and a process log at the bottom (pid, account, exit status,
Kill all).

```
cargo run --release -p aclauncher                  # open the window
cargo run -p aclauncher -- --dump-config           # print the config with defaults applied
cargo run -p aclauncher -- --dry-run myaccount     # print the command a launch would run
```

Each launch spawns a separate client process:

```
<client_binary> --data-dir <data_dir> --connect <host:port> -a <account> -v <password> [--character <name>] [--mute]
```

with its output appended to `~/.acswarm/logs/<account>.log`. Nothing is
killed when an account is removed or the launcher exits. "Launch headless"
adds `--mute` only; run `acswarm --headless` for no window at all. "Add /
create" is just adding an account: ACE creates it on the first login.

The config lives in `~/.acswarm/launcher.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": [{ "name": "Local ACE", "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 9000 }],
  "accounts": [{ "server": "Local ACE", "account": "myaccount", "password": "mypassword",
                 "characters": ["Reborn"], "last_character": "Reborn",
                 "last_used": "2026-09-04T12:00:00Z" }],
  "data_dir": "/Users/me/Downloads/ac_data",
  "client_binary": [],
  "password_notice_dismissed": false
}
```

`client_binary` is the program plus leading arguments; empty means the
`acswarm` next to the launcher binary if there is one, else
`cargo run -p acswarm --` from the workspace root. **Passwords are stored
in plain text** in this file; it is only as private as your home directory.

## Headless sessions (`acswarm --headless`)

`acswarm --headless` runs many sessions in one process with no window and
no GPU: the "as many clients as possible on one computer" case. Each
`--client` logs in, enters the world and is ticked `--tick-hz` times a
second (default 20; the loop sleeps in between, and 4 Hz is enough for the
server) with no keyboard input, so plugins and the server's own move-to
drive movement. The viewer's plugins (the panels' commands, console, party,
team and scripts) answer `/commands`, and the rules in the settings file
are played by (`--settings FILE`, or `--no-settings` for the defaults).

```
cargo run --release -p acswarm -- --headless --data-dir $AC_DATA_DIR --connect 127.0.0.1 \
    --client bot1:pw --client bot2:pw:Reborn --client bot3:pw \
    --tick-hz 10 --duration 300 --log-chat \
    --say "@telepoi holtburg" --say /combat --script walk.txt
```

`--say LINE` (repeatable) is typed by every session once its character is
placed, one line per second; `--script PATH` appends the lines of a text
file (blank lines and `#` comments skipped). Lines starting with `/` go to
the plugin host as commands, anything else is said to the server (`@`
commands included). `--duration 0` (the default) runs until Ctrl-C, which
disconnects every session cleanly; the run also ends when every session has
been terminated or refused. At start it prints the session count and tick
rate, and every 10 s one status line per session (placed?, cell, health,
target). `--log-chat` prints chat lines prefixed with the account;
`RUST_LOG=info` shows the connection log as well.

Workspace: fourteen library crates under `crates/` (DAT container and
decoders, scene assembly, wire protocol, world state, the vocabulary the
autoplay systems share, navigation, loot, vendoring, the game session,
plugins, scripting, the cross-process bus, audio) and three binaries
under `bins/`: `acswarm` (the client, windowed or `--headless`),
`aclauncher` (launch manager) and `acdat` (DAT CLI).
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) has a line per crate, the data flow, and the
build, test and logging commands.

Debugging aids: `RUST_LOG=acswarm=debug`, `ACV_HIDE_STATIC=1` (draw only
server objects), and in connected `--screenshot` mode `--walk`, `--say`,
`--click x,y`, `--use NAME`, `--attack NAME`, `--loot [NAME]`, `--buy NAME`,
`--sell NAME`, `--cast NAME`, `--jump`, `--snap-at SECS` and `--camera` to
script a session headlessly (`--say` may repeat; admin commands such as
`@create 7`, `@ci 314` or `@smite all` are handy for setting up a scene).
Double-clicking a vendor opens its shop (buy from the stock, sell from the
pack); using a scroll learns its spell.

Game data and the original executable are not distributed with this
repository and are gitignored.

## Scripting

The viewer runs every `*.rhai` file in `~/.acswarm/scripts` (or
`$ACSWARM_SCRIPTS`) through an embedded [Rhai](https://rhai.rs) engine
and reloads a file when it changes, so the client can be extended without
recompiling. A script defines `on_event(ev)`, `tick(dt)`,
`command(name, args)` and/or `key(name, pressed)`, and calls into the game
with the same verbs as the console: `me()`, `objects()`, `attack(name)`,
`cast(spell)`, `loot()`, `say(text)`, `post(topic, value)` /
`messages(topic)` for talking to other sessions, `with_session(i, || ...)`
to act as another one. `/scripts` lists what is loaded; script errors go
to the chat log and never stop the client. Examples and the full API are
in [`scripts/examples/`](scripts/examples/README.md); the plugin is
`crates/ac-script`.

## Releases

Pushing a tag `vX.Y.Z` runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`: a macOS disk
image (`acswarm.app`), Windows (x86_64 zip) and Linux
(x86_64 tar.gz, built on Ubuntu 22.04 for glibc compatibility) are
attached to a GitHub release with generated notes. Run it by hand from
the Actions tab to try the builds without tagging. Signing happens when
the secrets exist: `MACOS_CERT_P12_BASE64` / `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD` (and
`APPLE_ID` / `APPLE_TEAM_ID` / `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` to notarize) for
macOS, `WINDOWS_CERT_PFX_BASE64` / `WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD` for an
Authenticode signature on Windows; without them the archives are
unsigned (Gatekeeper wants a right-click Open, SmartScreen a "run
anyway"). Linux binaries are not signed.

## Releasing on macOS by hand

`tools/release/macos.sh VERSION` builds the binaries, wraps the viewer
in `acswarm.app` (the licence, README and example scripts inside it), signs everything with the "Developer ID Application"
identity in the login keychain (hardened runtime, timestamp) and packs
it all into `dist/acswarm-VERSION-macos.dmg` with an Applications
shortcut. Add `--notarize` to submit the app and then the disk image to
Apple and staple both tickets -- needed so Gatekeeper opens it on other
Macs; store the credentials first with
`xcrun notarytool store-credentials acswarm --apple-id ... --team-id ...
--password <app-specific password>`. `--universal` builds for Apple
silicon and Intel in one binary.
