# Regenerate crates/ac-world/data/creatures.csv: how much damage each
# kind of creature takes from each element.
#
# Every creature has a multiplier per damage type. Higher means it takes
# more: an Ice Golem's cold multiplier is 0 (it is immune) and its fire
# multiplier is 1. Choosing what to hit something with is choosing the
# type with the highest number, which is why the client wants this.
#
# This is server data, not in the client's own files, so it is read out
# of the local ACE world database (the community's reconstruction of
# retail's) and only needs regenerating when that data changes.
#
# The key is the weenie class id, which the server sends in every
# object description, so a creature in view is matched exactly. The name
# is kept beside it: it is what the rules are written in, and it catches
# a creature whose weenie is not in this copy of the data.
#
# Two more columns come from the same weenies, for deciding whether a
# creature is worth fighting at all rather than what to hit it with:
# tolerance (PropertyInt 67), the flags saying when the server lets it
# attack, and level (PropertyInt 25), what it is worth killing.
#
# Usage: reference/scripts/data/creatures.sh > crates/ac-world/data/creatures.csv

# An empty column means the creature has no figure for that element.
# tolerance is the server's flags for when it will attack; empty means
# it attacks whatever comes near. level is what it is worth killing,
# empty when it has none. Between them they tell a Rabbit from a
# Revenant, both of which stand there until they are hit.
