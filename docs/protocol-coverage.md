# Protocol coverage

What the client handles of the ACE wire protocol, audited on 2026-09-08
against `reference/ext/ACE/Source/ACE.Server/Network/{GameMessages,GameEvent,GameAction}`
(the opcode enums plus the `Messages/`, `Events/` and `Actions/` folders,
which say what ACE actually sends and accepts). Layouts are in
`crates/ac-net/src/messages/` (`opcode`, `event`, `action` modules, with
`opcode::name` / `event::name` for logs) and `crates/ac-world/src/object.rs`.

Status words:

* **handled**: parsed and applied to state (`World::apply` in
  `crates/ac-world/src/lib.rs`, the character sheet in `stats.rs`, or
  `ac_client::Client::tick` / `chat_message`).
* **parsed**: decoded, a bad body is reported, nothing reads the result.
* **named**: the constant exists so the debug log names it; not decoded.
* **never sent**: ACE has no serializer for it (an enum value only).

Seen-in-the-wild counts come from `RUST_LOG=ac_client=debug` on account
`acreborn2` ("Test Mage", level 1, stuck in the Training Academy, autoplay
on): a 5-minute session before the changes below and a 150-second one
after. Only messages that reached the "unhandled" log line are counted;
everything handled is not logged, so a zero means "handled or not seen".
The log line names each message now (`message 0xf748 UpdatePosition (40
bytes)`), so a future tally is
`grep -o 'message 0x[0-9a-f]* [A-Za-z_]*\|game event 0x[0-9a-f]* [A-Za-z_]*' LOG | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn`.

## Client to server

Everything the client sends, by ACE `GameActionType`, and what it never
sends. The transport layer (`crates/ac-net/src/session.rs`) also sends
`ConnectResponse`, `AckSequence` every 2 s, `EchoRequest` every 5 s with
real elapsed seconds (ACE's `VerifyEcho` compares client and server
deltas and boots for "speedhacking" past a threshold), `EchoResponse` to
each server echo, and retransmissions on request.

### C2S details checked against ACE

* **MoveToState** (`GameActionMoveToState`, `Network/Motion/MoveToState.cs`,
  `RawMotionState.cs`): flags in the low 11 bits, command count above
  them, optional hold key / stance / forward / sidestep / turn fields,
  then `(u16 command, u16 seq, f32 speed)` per command, the position,
  four u16 sequences and the contact byte, aligned. Matches. ACE reads
  the stance (`CurrentStyle`) into an unused field; the server's own
  stance comes from ChangeCombatMode, so sending NonCombat while in
  melee stance is harmless. The four sequences are read and never
  compared (`PositionPack` only writes them), so the constant 1/0/0/0 is
  fine. Any MoveToState cancels a server move-to chain, which the
  client already avoids while one runs.
* **AutonomousPosition**: position, four u16, contact byte, align.
  Matches; ACE reads it only when not teleporting. Retail sent one a
  second; the client's four a second is accepted.
* **Jump**: extent, velocity, four u16, then a u32 guid and u32 spell id
  ACE reads. Matches.
* **Echo timing**: `VerifyEcho` compares successive client echo times
  with server wall-clock deltas; a drift above `EchoThreshold` that
  keeps growing counts toward a boot. The client's echo carries real
  elapsed seconds, so it stays in step.
* **Target health**: `Player.HandleActionQueryHealth` selects the
  creature and sends UpdateHealth; `Player.Heartbeat` (every 5 s) sends
  it again for the selected target while it lives. Damage does not send
  it. Fixed by sending QueryHealth (above).
* **Fellow vitals**: `GameActionFellowshipUpdateRequest` records
  `FellowshipPanelOpen`; `Fellowship.OnVitalUpdate` sends
  FellowshipUpdateFellow only to members with it set, and the request
  itself answers with a FellowshipFullUpdate. Fixed (above).

| 16 | 0xF755 PlayEffect | now `Applied::Effect` / `Event::Effect` |
| 3 | game event 0x028B WeenieErrorWithString | was already a chat line; the log over-reported it (fixed) |
| 1 | game event 0x028A WeenieError | same |
| 1 | game event 0x01C8 AllegianceUpdateDone | ignored on purpose |
| 1 each | CharacterList, ServerName, DDD_Interrogation, DDD_EndDDD, ServerMessage | handled elsewhere; the log over-reported them (fixed) |

150-second session after the changes (same account and place):

| count | message | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| 321 | 0xF748 UpdatePosition | own echoes |
| 1 | game event 0x01C8 AllegianceUpdateDone | ignored on purpose |
| 1 each | CharacterList, ServerName, DDD_Interrogation, DDD_EndDDD | logged by the binary of that run; the lobby opcodes are silenced since |

Nothing unknown was seen in either session. The academy is a quiet
place: a session that fights, trades and travels through portals
would exercise PlayEffect, VectorUpdate, ParentEvent, PickupEvent and
the PK status updates, all of which are unit-tested from ACE's layouts.

## Left alone, and why

* UI-only events (barber, contracts, chess, house lists, channel lists,
  book editing) get a name in the log and nothing else: no bot reads
  them, and the lead asked for no UI.
* PublicUpdateProperty float/int64 on other objects: decoded so a short
  body is reported, but nothing in the world model reads a stranger's
  floats.
* CombatCommenceAttack: AttackDone already closes the attack; using the
  commence event to clear `attack_pending` earlier would let the client
  re-send an attack mid-swing, which ACE refuses.
* CharacterLogOff / a logoff request: the client disconnects, which ACE
  handles; a lobby round-trip needs a driver that wants it.
