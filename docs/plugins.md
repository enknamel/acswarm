# Writing a plugin

This is the reference for the in-process Rust surface. For the
task-oriented guide (panels, events, driving the character, sharing
state, scripts versus plugins versus processes, testing) see
[sdk.md](sdk.md); for a plugin to copy, `examples/plugin-template`.

A plugin is a plain Rust type implementing `ac_plugin::Plugin`, registered
with the `Host` in `bins/acswarm/src/plugins/mod.rs`. It sees every
session in the process through `Ctx`, can call any `ac_client::Client`
method, draw egui panels, take keys, and handle `/commands`. Plugins in
different sessions coordinate through the shared `Blackboard`.

The crate re-exports what you need: `ac_plugin::{Client, Event, Ctx,
Plugin, Blackboard, Message, Host, Requests, IconCache, IconLayers,
IconLoader, Settings, egui, serde_json, Value}`. The client's own panels are plugins
too (`ac_plugin::panels`, see below): read them as worked examples of a UI
plugin, or replace them.

## The `Plugin` trait

```rust
pub trait Plugin {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;

    /// A server event for `cx.client()` (chat lines, sounds, placement...).
    fn on_event(&mut self, _cx: &mut Ctx, _ev: &Event) {}

    /// Once per frame per session, after the session ticked.
    fn tick(&mut self, _cx: &mut Ctx) {}

    /// Draw panels for the active session. Runs inside the frame's egui
    /// pass; use `egui::Window`/`egui::Area` freely.
    fn ui(&mut self, _cx: &mut Ctx, _egui: &egui::Context) {}

    /// A key went down or up while no text box had focus. Return true to
    /// consume it so the client's own bindings ignore it.
    fn key(&mut self, _cx: &mut Ctx, _key: egui::Key, _pressed: bool) -> bool { false }

    /// `/name args` typed in the chat box. Return true when handled.
    fn command(&mut self, _cx: &mut Ctx, _name: &str, _args: &str) -> bool { false }

    /// Once, after the host read the settings file: take back what
    /// `save` stored last time (`settings.get::<T>(key)`).
    fn load(&mut self, _settings: &Settings) {}

    /// Before the host writes the settings file (on exit and every 30 s):
    /// store what should survive a restart (`settings.set(key, value)`).
    fn save(&self, _settings: &mut Settings) {}

    /// Session `index` was disconnected and dropped; the sessions after
    /// it now have one index less. A plugin keeping state by session
    /// index drops the entry and shifts the rest.
    fn session_removed(&mut self, _index: usize) {}
}
```

Call order each frame (`Host::frame`, once per session `i`): every
plugin's `on_event` for each of session `i`'s events, then its `tick`.
`ui`, `key` and `command` run with `index` = the active session. `key` and
`command` stop at the first plugin that returns `true`; an unhandled
command logs `Unknown command /name`.

`Event` (from `ac_client`):

```rust
pub enum Event {
    Chat { text: String, kind: u32 },   // kind = server ChatMessageType
    Sound { wave: Rc<Wave>, volume: f32 },
    Connected,
    Terminated(String),
    Refused(u32),                       // CharacterError / AccountBoot opcode
                                        // (the code is on Client::last_refusal)
    Placed { cell: u32 },               // the character stands in the world
    SpellLearned(u32), SpellForgotten(u32),
    Characters(Vec<CharacterEntry>),    // the account's list, when not auto-entering
    CharacterCreated { id: u32, name: String },
    CharacterCreateFailed(u32),         // ACE verification code (creation::create_failure_message)
    Autoplay { doing: String, text: String }, // autoplay switched to doing something else
}
```

`Autoplay` is emitted once per change of the rules' state: `doing` is
the state's name in lower case (`fighting`, `looting`, `buffing`,
`healing`, `debuffing`, `helping`, `following`, `fleeing`, `idle`) and
`text` the Autoplay panel's line. The host also posts each one on the
blackboard topic `autoplay.event` (`ac_plugin::AUTOPLAY_TOPIC`) as
`{"session", "name", "doing", "text"}`, so every session and every
process on the bus can follow what every character is doing.

## `Ctx`

```rust
pub struct Ctx<'a> {
    pub clients: Vec<&'a mut Client>, // every session, in order
    pub index: usize,                 // the session this callback is about
    pub board: &'a mut Blackboard,
    pub icons: &'a mut IconCache,     // item and spell icons as egui textures
    pub dt: f32,                      // seconds since the last frame (0 in ui/key/command)
    pub now: Instant,
    pub chat: Vec<(String, u32)>,     // lines to add to the active chat log
    pub activate: Option<usize>,      // ask the host to switch the active session
}

impl Ctx<'_> {
    pub fn client(&mut self) -> &mut Client;   // self.clients[self.index]
    pub fn try_client(&mut self) -> Option<&mut Client>; // None when the host has no session (--demo-ui)
    pub fn client_count(&self) -> usize;
    pub fn icons(&mut self) -> &mut IconCache;
    pub fn log(&mut self, text: impl Into<String>);            // chat line, kind 0 (system)
    pub fn post(&mut self, topic: impl Into<String>, value: impl Into<Value>); // bus, from this session
}
```

### Icons

`cx.icons()` turns RenderSurface (0x06) ids into egui textures on first
use and paints them: `cx.icons().draw(ui, IconLayers::of(object),
egui::Sense::click())` draws an object's icon with its overlay and
underlay as a 24-point square and returns the `Response`;
`IconLayers::single(spell.icon_id)` for a spell. The decoder behind it is
installed once by the host (`Host::set_icon_loader`, an `Rc<dyn Fn(u32)
-> Option<Rgba>>` over `Assets::texture_rgba`); a host that never draws
installs none and `draw` paints nothing.

### `Client` fields worth reading

| field | what it is |
|---|---|
| `config: Config` | `host`, `account`, `password`, `character` of this session. |
| `world: ac_world::World` | Everything the server described: see below. |
| `assets: Rc<ac_scene::Assets>` | The DAT loader; `spell_table()`, `skill_table()`, `region()`, `setup(id)`, ... |
| `player: Option<player::Player>` | Our physics body once placed: `cell`, `local`, `heading`, `stance`, `world_position()`, `forward()`, `landblock()`, `is_indoors()`, `is_airborne()`, `busy()`, `turn(d_yaw)`. |
| `scene_block: Option<u32>` | Landblock the scene is built around; `placed()` is `scene_block.is_some()`. |
| `combat: bool`, `magic: bool` | Melee and magic combat modes. |
| `attack_target: Option<u32>` | Creature we keep swinging at until it dies or `attack_target = None`. |
| `attack_pending: bool` | A swing was sent and AttackDone has not come back. |
| `last_target_name: String` | Name of the last creature attacked (its corpse is what `/loot` opens). |
| `move_to: Option<MoveTarget>` | A server-requested MoveTo we are carrying out. |
| `selected: Option<u32>` | The selected object (target bar, appraisal, targeted casts). |
| `known_spells: HashMap<u32, String>` | Spells learnt from scrolls this session, by name. |
| `loot_queue: VecDeque<u32>`, `loot_inflight: Option<(u32, Instant)>` | Items still to take from the open container, and the one in flight. |
| `characters: Vec<CharacterEntry>` | The account's character list. |
| `session: ac_net::session::Session` | Raw access: `send_action(action, body)`, `send_message(queue, msg)` for anything `Client` has no method for. |

### `World` (`crates/ac-world/src/lib.rs`)

| item | meaning |
|---|---|
| `objects: HashMap<u32, WorldObject>` | Every object the server created, by guid. |
| `player_guid: Option<u32>`, `player()`, `player_mut()` | Our own object. |
| `stats: PlayerStats` | The character sheet (below). |
| `open_container: Option<(u32, Vec<u32>)>` | A corpse or chest we are looking into: its guid and item guids. |
| `open_vendor: Option<ApproachVendor>` | The vendor we are trading with: `vendor`, `items: Vec<VendorItem>` (`guid`, `stack`, `desc.name`, `desc.value`), `buy_rate`, `sell_rate`. |
| `generation: u64` | Bumped whenever a drawable object or position changes. |
| `inventory()`, `wielded()` | Iterators over our pack items and equipped items. |
| `drawable()` | Objects with a position and a model (what is in view). |

`WorldObject`: `guid`, `name`, `weenie_class_id`, `setup_id`,
`motion_table_id`, `position: Option<Position>` (`cell`, `local`,
`rotation`), `display` (smoothed position), `world_pos()`,
`object_desc_flags` (`object_desc_flags::{PLAYER, ATTACKABLE, VENDOR,
DOOR, CORPSE, PORTAL, STUCK, OPENABLE}`), `item_type`
(`item_type::{CREATURE, CONTAINER, WIELDABLE, ...}`), `container`,
`wielder`, `stack_size`, `value`, `spell_id`, `health: Option<f32>`
(fraction, creatures we have hit), `is_player`, `motion` (current stance
and forward command), `target: Option<MoveTarget>`. `ac_world::
landblock_origin(cell) + position.local` is the world position.

`PlayerStats` (`crates/ac-world/src/stats.rs`): `name`, `level`,
`total_xp`, `available_xp`, `skill_credits`, `attributes: [Attribute; 6]`
(Strength, Endurance, Quickness, Coordination, Focus, Self; `value()`),
`vitals: [Vital; 3]` (Health, Stamina, Mana; `current`), `vital_max(i)`,
`skills: Vec<Skill>`, `skill(id)`, `skill_value(skill, base)`, `spells:
Vec<u32>` (known spell ids), `enchantments`, `inventory`, `wielded`,
`options` (shortcuts, spell bars).

### `Client` methods (actions)

| method | effect |
|---|---|
| `tick(input: Option<player::Input>, dt, now) -> PlayerFrame` | Pump the network, apply messages, run timers and physics. The host calls this; plugins do not. |
| `drain_events() -> Vec<Event>` | Events since the last drain (the host drains and passes them to `on_event`). |
| `placed() -> bool` | The character is in the world. |
| `say(text)` | Local chat, or an `@command`. |
| `select(guid: Option<u32>)` | Set the selection (targeted spells go to it). |
| `interact(guid)` | Double-click semantics: attack if in melee and attackable, wield/unwield carried items, pick up ground items, else Use (doors, NPCs, corpses, vendors, portals). |
| `use_by_name(name) -> bool` | `interact` on the nearest object whose name starts with `name` (carried items win, exact names beat prefixes); false if nothing matches yet. |
| `toggle_combat()` | Melee mode on/off (`combat`); leaving it clears the attack target. |
| `attack(guid)` | One TargetedMeleeAttack and set `attack_target`; `tick_combat` re-swings until the target dies. Needs `combat`. |
| `cast(spell_id)` | Enter magic mode if needed, then cast: self-targeted spells untargeted, others at `selected` (or ourselves). |
| `known_spell_ids()`, `spell(id)`, `spellbook_filters()`, `set_spellbook_filters(bits)`, `forget_spell(id)` | The spellbook (`ac_client::magic`). |
| `spell_bars()`, `add_to_spell_bar(bar, pos, id)`, `remove_from_spell_bar(bar, id)` | The eight server-persisted spell bars. |
| `enchantments()`, `components()`, `has_focus(school)`, `current_formula(id)`, `can_cast(id)`, `set_desired_component(id, n)`, `clear_desired_components()`, `fill_components(kind, budget)` | Buffs, components and the cast pre-check. |
| `take(guid)` | Queue an item of the open container for pickup. |
| `close_container()` | Stop viewing the open container. |
| `buy(guid)`, `sell(guid)`, `close_vendor()` | Trade with `world.open_vendor`. |
| `disconnect(now)` | Clean disconnect. |

`player::Input { forward: f32, strafe: f32, run: bool, jump: bool, jump_held: bool }` (`jump` is a full-power jump this frame, `jump_held` charges one while true and leaps when it goes false) is
what the host builds from the keys for the active session; a plugin cannot
steer the character directly yet, but `client.player.heading` and
`client.move_to` are public, and setting `move_to = Some(MoveTarget::
Position { cell, local })` makes `tick` run there.

## Blackboard and bus

```rust
pub struct Blackboard { pub values: HashMap<String, Value>, /* inbox, outbox */ }
impl Blackboard {
    pub fn get(&self, key: &str) -> Option<&Value>;
    pub fn set(&mut self, key: impl Into<String>, value: impl Into<Value>);
    pub fn post(&mut self, from: usize, topic: impl Into<String>, value: impl Into<Value>);
    pub fn messages(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &Message>;
    pub fn messages_on<'a>(&'a self, topic: &'a str) -> impl Iterator<Item = &'a Message> + 'a;
}
pub struct Message { pub from: usize, pub topic: String, pub value: Value }
```

* `values` persist for the life of the process: use them for shared facts
  (`board.set("leader", 0)`, `board.get("leader")`).
* Messages posted this frame (`cx.post(topic, value)`) are readable by every
  plugin, for every session, during the next frame only. `Host::end_frame`
  rotates the queues after all sessions ran.
* Values are `serde_json::Value`; use `serde_json::json!({...})` for
  structured payloads and `.as_u64()` etc. to read them.

## Registering a plugin

`bins/acswarm/src/plugins/mod.rs`:

```rust
pub use ac_plugin::panels;
pub use ac_plugin::{Host, Requests};

pub fn builtin() -> Host {
    let mut host = Host::new();
    for p in panels::live() {          // every built-in panel, first
        host.register(p);
    }
    host.register(Box::new(ac_plugin::team::Team::default()));
    host.register(Box::new(ac_script::ScriptPlugin::new(
        ac_script::default_dir(),
    )));
    host
}
```

A plugin of your own is one more line here: for the auto-heal example
below, `pub mod autoheal;` at the top and
`host.register(Box::new(autoheal::AutoHeal::default()))`.
`acswarm --headless` builds its own host with the same list in
`bins/acswarm/src/headless.rs` (`run`); register it there too to have it
run with no window.

Order matters for `key` and `command` (first to return `true` wins), so
put plugins that claim generic keys last; the panels go first so they draw
under everything else and own I, K, P, B, O, U and (while the spell bar is
visible) `1`..`9`, Insert, Delete, PageUp and PageDown. Any binary that drives sessions
can host plugins the same way: `Host::new()`, `register`, then
`frame`/`ui`/`key`/`command`/`end_frame` (see `crates/ac-plugin/src/host.rs`).

## Settings

What the UI remembers between runs lives in `~/.config/acswarm/ui.json`
(`$ACSWARM_CONFIG_DIR` overrides the directory): where every panel was
dragged, which panels are open, and each panel's own state (the
inventory's search, chips, sort and folded packs; the map's tab, follow
and zoom). The host reads it at startup, writes it when the window
closes and every 30 s if anything changed, and the options panel's
"Reset window layout" forgets the saved positions.

A plugin joins in with two optional `Plugin` hooks:

```rust
fn load(&mut self, settings: &Settings) {
    if let Some(v) = settings.get("myplugin.show") { self.show = v; }
}
fn save(&self, settings: &mut Settings) {
    settings.set("myplugin.show", self.show);
}
```

`Settings::get::<T>` and `set` take anything `serde` can carry; prefix
keys with the plugin's name. `cx.settings` reaches the same store from
`ui`/`tick`.

## The built-in panels

`crates/ac-plugin/src/panels/` holds the client's own overlay, one plugin
per file: `vitals`, `radar`, `target`, `inventory` (I; grouped by pack,
searchable with `ac_client::items::Query` lines such as `dmg>10 spell:blood
type:armor`, sortable, with stat tooltips and a background "Appraise all"),
`nameplates` (V; names over creatures, players and portals in the 3D
view, projected through the camera the host publishes on the blackboard
as `camera.view_proj`), `map` (M; world map, a local map of the landblocks around the character
(seven across by default, up to eleven, drawn on a background thread), from the terrain grid, local map or dungeon floor
plan, objects in the landblock with search and kind chips, overland
travel by double-click or town name), `loot` (search, kind chips, stat tooltips, "Take all" and "Appraise
all"), `vendor` (the same over both lists, plus a sort and "Sell all
shown"),
`skills` (K), `spellbook` (P), `spellbar` (B), `components`, `buffs`, `trade`, `fellowship`, `allegiance`, `housing` (a used house sign opens it), `social`
(title, friends, squelches), `book` (opens on a used book, sign or
plaque), `appraisal` (shows the last thing assessed, and never opens by
itself), `salvage`
(opens when the Ust is used), `confirm` (the
server's Yes/No questions), `options`, `combat` (the height/power bar),
`autoplay` (see below), `fleet` (every character being played, in this
process and on the bus, with autoplay/follow/regroup/stop controls; see
`docs/multi-session.md`, "Fleet view"), `holdings` ("Items": every
character's inventory on every account, online or not, searched with
the inventory's query language; see `docs/multi-session.md`, "Items
across characters"), `menu` (Escape: every panel
with its key, the keys themselves, and Quit). Only the inventory (I), map (M), skills (K),
spellbook (P) and spell bar (B) have a key out of the box; the menu opens
the rest, and any key can be changed there -- the bindings live in the
settings file, so every client on the machine shares them (`crate::keys`).
Every window has a title bar with a close button, and Escape closes the
window opened last before it opens the menu. Each
has the same three parts, so any of them is a template for a UI plugin:

* `view(&Client) -> View`: a plain struct of what to draw, built from the
  session each frame (`world.stats`, `inventory()`, `open_container`,
  `open_vendor`, the spell tables through `client.assets`);
* `draw(&egui::Context, ..) -> actions`: the egui code, returning what was
  clicked (guids to take or buy, spell ids to cast);
* the `Plugin` impl: `ui` builds the view, draws it, and calls
  `Client` (`interact`, `take`, `close_container`, `buy`, `sell`,
  `close_vendor`, `cast`); `key` toggles the panel.

Every panel is a borderless `egui::Window` (or `Area`) built by
`panels::window(name, pos, size, alpha, margin)`: fixed size, no title bar,
opened at `pos` and movable by dragging any part of it that no widget
claims (item and spell rows keep their own drag-and-drop, scroll areas
their drag-to-scroll). egui remembers where each was moved for the rest of
the session and keeps it inside the viewport; positions computed from the
viewport size (the centred target bar, the radar in the corner) are only
recomputed for a panel that has not been moved. "Reset window layout" in
the options panel (X) calls `egui::Memory::reset_areas`, which puts every
panel back at its default position.

A panel's data comes from a `Source<View>`: `Live` (the session) or
`Demo(view)` (canned data whose actions are dropped). `Panel::demo()`
constructors feed `acswarm --screenshot --demo-ui`, which registers
`panels::demo(assets)` instead of `builtin()` and renders the overlay with
no server; `Ctx::try_client()` is `None` there. To replace a panel,
register your own plugin instead of it in `builtin()`; the skills panel
publishes whether it is open on the blackboard (`panels::skills::OPEN_KEY`)
so the spellbook can sit beside it, a small example of panels talking. The
spellbook, components, spell bar and autoplay panels do the same
(`panels::spellbook::OPEN_KEY`, `panels::components::OPEN_KEY`,
`panels::spellbar::{SHOWN_KEY, VISIBLE_KEY}`).

**autoplay** (J) is the panel over `ac_client::autoplay`, the rules the
character follows when nobody is at the keyboard: a "Play on its own"
checkbox on `client.autoplay.config.enabled`, a line reading
`autoplay.doing.label()` and `autoplay.status` ("fighting Drudge
Skulker"), and a section per rule group — Stay alive (the heal threshold
as a percentage slider, healing kits, the healing spell), Buffs (the
spells to keep up, how many seconds before they run out to recast, whether
to bother in combat), Fight (radius, and the names to take on or leave
alone) and Loot (searches in the inventory's own language, plus names
always or never taken). The five editable lists share one helper (a row
per entry with an `x`, and an add line); beside each loot search is the
number of carried items it matches right now (`client.item_stats()` run
through `ac_client::items::Query`, counted once a frame), so a rule can be
checked before it is trusted. The whole `Config` is edited in place on the
session and stored under `autoplay.config`, then handed to each session as
it appears, so the rules survive a restart.

The magic panels follow `docs/game/mechanics.md` (section 1) and build on
`ac_client::magic`:

* **spellbook** (P): known spells (`known_spell_ids`, `spell`) in display
  order, filtered by the server-side bits (`spellbook_filters`,
  `set_spellbook_filters`) with one toggle per school and level.
  Double-click or drag a spell onto the spell bar or one of its tabs to add
  it (`add_to_spell_bar`); right-click or `i` for details (school, level,
  mana, duration, description, the current formula from `current_formula`
  with each component's presence, Cast, and Delete with confirmation →
  `forget_spell`).
* **spellbar** (B; also shown while the spellbook is open or `client.magic`
  is set): the eight tabs from `spell_bars`. `1`..`9` cast the nth spell of
  the shown tab; PageUp / Insert show the next / previous tab, PageDown /
  Delete select the next / previous spell, Ctrl jumps to the last / first;
  Shift+Delete or Remove takes the selected spell off (`remove_from_spell_bar`);
  click selects, double-click or Cast casts (`cast`). Hovering shows
  `can_cast`'s verdict (no caster, missing components by name, mana); such
  spells are dimmed but still castable, the server has the last word.
* **components**: `components()` grouped by kind with the count and an
  editable desired quantity 0..999 (`set_desired_component`), the foci
  carried per school (`has_focus`), and "Fill from vendor"
  (`fill_components`, enabled while `world.open_vendor` is set).
* **buffs** (U, on by default): `enchantments()` split into beneficial and
  harmful by the SpellTable flag, soonest to expire first, vitae as
  "Vitae -N%". Time left is `duration + start_time - elapsed`: ACE sends
  `start_time` as the non-positive seconds the spell has already run, so
  the panel anchors each value to the local clock when it first sees it
  and needs no server time base.

## Character select and creation

`crates/ac-plugin/src/lobby/` is the screen between login and the world,
built the same way as the panels (`view` / `draw` / state, a demo mode with
no session) and driven by `ac_client::creation`:

* **select** (`lobby::select`): `view(&Client)` lists `client.characters`
  (name, "deleting in Xs" for one pending deletion); `draw` returns
  `SelectAction::{Enter, Delete, Restore, New}` and `key` handles Up/Down,
  Enter (the highlighted character; it also confirms a pending delete) and
  Escape. `Lobby` turns them into `client.enter_world(id)`,
  `delete_character(id)` (after a Yes/No strip), `restore_character(id)`
  and opens the creation screen.
* **create** (`lobby::create`): `CreateState` owns a `CharacterBuild` plus
  its `Rules` and the `CharGen` table, and walks `Step::{Heritage,
  Appearance, Attributes, Skills, Finish}` (`next`/`prev`; Left/Right or
  PageUp/PageDown). Heritage hides the Olthoi groups unless "Show all";
  appearance steps through the sex's hair, eye, nose, mouth and clothing
  option lists; attributes show `attribute_points_left` (red when
  negative, `points_color`) with -10/-1/drag/+1/+10; skills are grouped
  Specialized / Trained / Untrained / Unusable (`group_skills`) with each
  skill's train and specialize cost and Specialize / Train / Untrain / Drop
  buttons that call `build.set_skill` (refusals become the message line);
  the finish pane has the name (`valid_name` feedback), the starting town
  and a summary. Create is enabled while `build.validate(&rules)` passes
  (the first error is shown otherwise) and calls
  `client.create_character(&build)`; `Event::CharacterCreateFailed` puts
  the server's reason on the screen, `Event::CharacterCreated` returns to
  the list while the client enters the world.
* `Lobby` (`lobby::Lobby`) holds both screens, follows the events
  (`Characters` opens the list, `Placed` hides everything) and implements
  `Plugin`, but acswarm owns it directly rather than registering it: the
  viewer reads `Lobby::preview()` (the build being edited) every frame and
  draws the model beside the creation window with the `--chargen` path
  (`ac_scene::chargen::describe` → `instances_for` →
  `set_player_instances`), turning slowly or by right-drag. Clothing is
  sent but not previewed.

`acswarm --demo-select` and `--demo-create` show the two screens with no
server (three sample characters; the real CharGen table and the 3D
preview). With `--screenshot out.png` they render one frame headlessly, and
`--press ArrowRight,ArrowRight` first steps the creation screen to the
pane you want to see.

## Worked example: auto-heal

Casts Heal Self when health drops under half, at most every four seconds;
`/autoheal` toggles it. Save as `bins/acswarm/src/plugins/autoheal.rs`
and register it as above. (This file type-checks against the current
crates.)

```rust
//! Auto-heal: cast Heal Self whenever health drops under half.
//! `/autoheal` toggles it.

use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

use ac_plugin::{Client, Ctx, Plugin};

pub struct AutoHeal {
    enabled: bool,
    last_cast: Option<Instant>,
}

impl Default for AutoHeal {
    fn default() -> Self {
        AutoHeal {
            enabled: true,
            last_cast: None,
        }
    }
}

impl AutoHeal {
    /// The Heal Self the character knows: first from the spellbook (ids in
    /// `world.stats.spells`, named through the portal's SpellTable), else a
    /// scroll read this session.
    fn heal_self(c: &Client) -> Option<u32> {
        let table = c.assets.spell_table().ok()?;
        c.world

Notes: `tick` runs once per session, so with three `--client`s each
character heals itself and `self.last_cast` is shared; keep per-session
state in a `Vec` indexed by `cx.index` when that matters. Health arrives
as `PrivateUpdateAttribute2ndLevel` and is applied to
`stats.vitals[0].current` before your `tick` sees it. ACE needs spell
components unless `@modifybool require_spell_comps false`.

## An agent-style plugin

A bot that plays the game is the same shape, with a perceive / decide /
act loop in `tick` and coordination over the bus:

**Perceive** from `cx.client().world`: `drawable()` for what is in view,
`object_desc_flags & ATTACKABLE` plus `item_type & CREATURE` for monsters,
`health` for ones we have hit, `player().position` and
`landblock_origin(cell) + local` for distances, `stats.vitals` for our own
state, `open_container`/`open_vendor` for what is open, and the `Event`s
in `on_event` (`Chat` lines carry server errors and `TransientString`
refusals as text).

**Decide** with plain state in the plugin struct: a small enum per session
(`Idle`, `Fighting(guid)`, `Looting`, `Healing`) indexed by `cx.index`,
with `Instant`s for timeouts, because the server answers asynchronously
and some answers never come.

**Act** through `Client`: `toggle_combat` + `attack(guid)` (or
`use_by_name`), `cast`, `interact`/`use_by_name` on corpses and doors,
`take` per item, `buy`/`sell`, `say`, and `session.send_action` for the
rest.

**Coordinate**: `cx.post("assist", json!({"target": guid}))` from the
leader; followers read `cx.board.messages_on("assist")` next frame and
`attack` the same guid. `board.set("leader", index)` for facts that must
persist. `cx.activate = Some(i)` switches the window to a session that
needs eyes on it.

Protocol facts from [subsystems/net.md](subsystems/net.md) that shape a
bot:

* **Server-driven MoveTo.** Using or attacking something out of reach makes
  ACE send a MoveTo for our guid and poll our reported position; ACE does
  not move us. `Client` runs toward `move_to` and holds MoveToState until
  the server says idle (any MoveToState cancels the chain). While
  `client.move_to.is_some()` do not re-send the action; `tick_combat`
  already waits. A move-to times out after 12 s.
* **One pickup at a time.** The server refuses a second PutItemInContainer
  while one is in flight (`YoureTooBusy`). `take(guid)` queues and
  `tick_loot` sends one at a time, waiting for the item to land or 4 s;
  check `loot_queue.is_empty() && loot_inflight.is_none()` before closing
  the container or walking off.
* **AttackDone semantics.** Every swing sequence ends with AttackDone
  carrying `ActionCancelled` (0x36); that is the normal end, not a
  failure. `attack_pending` is cleared there and `tick_combat` re-swings
  after `attack_backoff` (300 ms). Watch `world.objects[target].health`
  (fraction) and the `Chat` kill line; `attack_target` becomes `None` when
  the target is gone.
* **Lifestone protection.** After a respawn attacks are refused (WeenieError
  0x0502) or the protection is dispelled by acting; back off on the
  "cannot attack" transient strings rather than hammering.
* **Modes.** `cast` flips to magic mode and clears `combat`; call
  `toggle_combat` again before the next melee swing. `toggle_combat` off
  also drops `attack_target`.
* **Names, not guids, across sessions.** Guids are per object and stable
  while the object exists, so a guid on the bus is fine; names are for
  humans and `use_by_name` prefix matching.
