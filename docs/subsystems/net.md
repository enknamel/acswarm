# Network protocol

Implemented in `crates/ac-net`. Sources: ACE `Source/ACE.Server/Network/*`
(the server side we must interoperate with), `ACE.Common/Cryptography`, and
the client (`FUN_00542570` header hash, `FUN_00542780` packet assembly,
`FUN_00542650` sendto over WSOCK32 ordinal 20).

## Transport

UDP. The client talks to the server's login port (9000) and, after the
handshake, sends `ConnectResponse` once to port+1 (9001). The server sends
everything from 9001 back to the client's endpoint. One client socket works
for both.

## Packet

```
u32 sequence   u32 flags   u32 checksum   u16 id   u16 time   u16 size   u16 iteration
[optional header fields, in flag order]
[fragments, if BlobFragments]
```

* `size` counts everything after the 20-byte header. Max 464.
* `id` is the server-assigned client id from `ConnectRequest` (server
  packets carry the server id, 0xB in ACE).
* `checksum = hash32(header with checksum = 0xBADD70DD) + (P ^ K)`, with
  `P = hash32(optional bytes) + Σ (hash32(fragment header) + hash32(fragment data))`
  and `K` the next ISAAC key when `EncryptedChecksum` is set, else 0.
* `hash32(data) = (len << 16) + Σ le_u32 + trailing bytes into the high
  bytes first`.

Flags (`packet::flags`): Retransmission 0x1, EncryptedChecksum 0x2,
BlobFragments 0x4, ServerSwitch 0x100, Referral 0x800, RequestRetransmit
0x1000 (u32 count + seqs), RejectRetransmit 0x2000, AckSequence 0x4000
(u32), LoginRequest 0x10000 (body = login request), WorldLoginRequest
0x20000, ConnectRequest 0x40000 (f64 time, u64 cookie, u32 client id, u32
server seed, u32 client seed, u32 pad), ConnectResponse 0x80000 (u64
cookie), NetError 0x100000 / NetErrorDisconnect 0x200000 (u32, u32),
CICMDCommand 0x400000, TimeSync 0x1000000 (f64), EchoRequest 0x2000000
(f32), EchoResponse 0x4000000 (f32, f32), Flow 0x8000000 (u32, u16).

## Fragment

```
u32 sequence  u32 id  u16 count  u16 size(incl. 16)  u16 index  u16 queue  data
```

A message larger than 448 bytes is split into `count` fragments sharing a
sequence. Fragment sequences are per direction, start at 1, and must be
delivered in order (ACE holds early ones). `queue` is the message group
(UI = 9, Weenie = 3, Database = 5, ...).

## ISAAC

Not standard ISAAC (`isaac.rs`): the key schedule mixes only the golden
ratio, then `a = b = c = seed` and one scramble; keys are read from index
255 downwards. Two streams per session: server->client seeded with the
first seed in `ConnectRequest`, client->server with the second. A receiver
searches up to 256 keys ahead for a match so lost packets do not
desynchronise it. Verified against ACE for three seeds
(`tests/golden/net/isaac_*.txt`). See "Surviving a real link" for how the
receive window is bounded.

## Surviving a real link (2026-09-08)

Everything below is invisible on localhost, which never loses, reorders
or duplicates a packet, and was behind random disconnects on a public
server.

- **The receive key window must not latch.** `KeyStream` holds the keys
  it has generated but nobody has claimed, tagged with their index in the
  stream, plus a ring of the last 256 keys it used. A packet is accepted
  if its key is the next one (the lossless case, one comparison), one
  still waiting in the window (reordered, or a retransmission, which
  keeps its original key), or one already used (a duplicate). Otherwise
  the stream is extended, but never more than 256 keys past the newest
  key accepted, so unrecognised packets cannot walk the window away from
  the server. Unclaimed keys are dropped oldest first once they fall 256
  behind. The straight port of ACE's `CryptoSystem`, which took its
  search budget from the space left in a set that nothing ever emptied,
  died permanently after roughly 256 lost packets: measured at 10% loss,
  it accepted 2307 packets and then rejected every one after 2564, at
  which point the client silently discarded all server traffic, stopped
  acking and was dropped.
- **A single lost packet has to be re-requested.** ACE only asks once two
  or more packets are missing, because on its side the client volunteers
  resends. The client asks for a wider gap at once and for a single
  missing packet after 250 ms, which is long enough for a reordered
  packet to arrive on its own. Requests are rate limited to one a second
  and carry at most 115 sequence numbers, which is all ACE reads.
- **A retransmission must have its checksum rebuilt.** Setting the
  Retransmission flag changes the header, and the header is hashed into
  the checksum. Keep the original ISAAC key, which is what the peer
  matches on, and recompute: the key-carrying half of the checksum is
  `checksum - hash32(header)`, which the flag does not change. Sending
  the old checksum makes the peer derive a key from nobody's stream,
  which on ACE burns 256 keys of its copy of our stream per attempt.
- **Nothing may wait for ever.** A hole in the packet sequence that the
  server explicitly refuses to fill (RejectRetransmit) is stepped over at
  once; one that ten requests have not filled is stepped over after ten
  seconds. A complete message waiting on a fragment that never arrives is
  released after five seconds, or once 256 messages have piled up behind
  it. Half-assembled multi-fragment messages and the out-of-order buffer
  are capped. Losing a message costs a stale object; waiting for ever
  costs the session, which stays "connected" and never processes another
  packet.
- **Say why a session died.** Every termination goes through one helper
  that logs the reason at warn before raising the event: net error code
  and table, CharacterError translated to a phrase, account boot, a
  ConnectResponse the server never accepted. Checksum mismatches are
  counted and reported at most once every five seconds with the running
  total and the number of unclaimed keys; ten seconds of silence from the
  server is reported once.

## Login flow

| dir | packet / message | notes |
|---|---|---|
| C2S :9000 | `LoginRequest` seq 0, plain | body: string16 "1802", u32 len, u32 auth type 2, u32 flags 0, u32 timestamp, string16 account, string16 "", u32 len, u8 pwlen, password |
| S2C | `ConnectRequest` | cookie, client id, seeds |
| C2S :9001 | `ConnectResponse` seq 1, plain, id = client id | u64 cookie |
| S2C | `ServerName` 0xF7E1, `CharacterList` 0xF658, `DDD_Interrogation` 0xF7E5 | first encrypted data |
| C2S | `DDD_InterrogationResponse` 0xF7E6 (queue 5) | u32 language 1, i32 n, per dat: i32 type, i32 id, i32 iterations, i32 -(iterations+1); i32 0; u32 0 |
| S2C | `DDD_EndDDD` 0xF7EA (or `DDD_BeginDDD` if iterations differ and patching is on) | |
| C2S | `CharacterEnterWorldRequest` 0xF7C8 | opcode only |
| S2C | `CharacterEnterWorldServerReady` 0xF7DF | |
| C2S | `CharacterEnterWorld` 0xF657 | u32 character id, string16 account |
| S2C | `PlayerCreate` 0xF746, `ObjectCreate` 0xF745 ..., `GameEvent` 0xF7B0 (PlayerDescription 0x13 ...) | in world |

The client's first data packet is sequence 2 (ACE initialises its last
received sequence to 1). Acks: flag 0x4000 with the last processed server
sequence, sent every ~2 s. Echo: client sends `EchoRequest(f32 client
time)`; server answers `EchoResponse`; ACE also compares clocks for
speed-hack detection, so the time must advance in real seconds.

## Message framing

Every fragment payload starts with `u32 opcode`. `GameEvent` 0xF7B0 bodies
are `u32 guid, u32 sequence, u32 event type, ...`; `GameAction` 0xF7B1 are
`u32 sequence, u32 action type, ...`. Strings are `string16` (u16 length,
bytes, pad to 4).

## Verified against ACE (2026-09-04)

A headless session with `--create` logs in, creates a character, enters the world and
receives PlayerDescription, PlayerCreate and ~30 ObjectCreate messages.
Three ACE behaviours that are not obvious from the protocol alone:

* **First data packet is sequence 2.** ACE initialises its own
  last-received counter to 1 and skips sequence 1 when it starts encrypted
  sending; the client must also start at 1 or it buffers seq 2 forever.
* **ConnectResponse races password verification.** ACE sends the
  ConnectRequest before it has finished bcrypt-verifying the password and
  only accepts a ConnectResponse afterwards (~20-40 ms later). Replying
  within microseconds gets the response silently dropped, so the session
  resends it every 250 ms until the first data packet arrives.
* **Do not list a DAT the server lacks.** ACE dereferences its own copy of
  each archive named in `DDD_InterrogationResponse`; a server without
  `client_local_English.dat` throws a NullReferenceException and never
  answers. The client reports only portal and cell.

Debugging: set the `Packets` logger to DEBUG in
`reference/ace-run/Config/log4net.config` (picked up live) and read
`/ace/Logs/ACE_Log.txt` in the container; `<<<` lines are inbound.

## Gameplay facts verified against ACE (2026-09-05)

- **Server-driven MoveTo.** Using or attacking something out of reach makes
  ACE send a MovementEvent (0xF74C, type 6 MoveToObject / 7 MoveToPosition)
  for our own guid and then poll `WithinUseRadius` against the position we
  report. ACE does not move the player itself. Any MoveToState (0xF61C) we
  send while `IsPlayerMovingTo` cancels that chain (ActionCancelled), so the
  client must keep sending AutonomousPosition (0xF753) but hold MoveToState
  until the server describes us idle again (a MovementEvent for our guid
  with no target). Our own echoed motion states also arrive as
  MovementEvents; they carry no target.
- **Melee.** ChangeCombatMode (0x0053, u32 mode: 1 peace, 2 melee) switches
  the stance, broadcast back as our MovementEvent style. TargetedMeleeAttack
  (0x0008: target, attack height u32, power f32). Every swing sequence ends
  with AttackDone (0x01A7) carrying WeenieError 0x36 ActionCancelled: that is
  the normal end, not a failure. Blows arrive as AttackerNotification 0x01B1
  / DefenderNotification 0x01B2 (string16 name, u32 damage type, f64 percent,
  u32 damage, [u32 location], u32 critical, u64 conditions) and evasions as
  0x01B3/0x01B4 (string16). UpdateHealth 0x01C0 (guid, f32) gives the target's
  health fraction. Deaths: VictimNotification 0x01AC / KillerNotification
  0x01AD (string16).
- **Lifestone protection.** After a respawn the player cannot attack or be
  attacked for a while; attacks are refused with WeenieError 0x0502 or
  dispelled ("Your actions have dispelled the Lifestone's magic!").
- **Loot.** Use on a corpse or chest opens it: ViewContents (0x0196: container
  guid, count, [item guid, container type]) plus ObjectCreates for the items
  with their container set. PutItemInContainer (0x0019: item, container,
  placement) moves one item; the server refuses a second pickup while one is
  in flight (WeenieError 0x1D YoureTooBusy and InventoryServerSaveFailed
  0x00A0: item guid, error), so take items one at a time and wait for the
  InventoryPutObjInContainer event (0x0022). NoLongerViewingContents (0x0195,
  container guid) closes it.
- **Jump.** Jump (0xF61B): f32 extent, f32x3 velocity in the character's
  local frame, four u16 sequences, then a u32 object guid and u32 spell id
  that ACE reads even though they are unused. Launch velocity: vz =
  sqrt(19.6 * h), h from the jump skill and charge (see player.rs).
- **Errors as text.** CommunicationTransientString 0x02EB (string16) carries
  the "You cannot attack X" style messages; WeenieError 0x028A (u32) and
  WeenieErrorWithString 0x028B (u32, string16) the coded ones.
- **Vendors.** Use on a vendor answers ApproachVendor (0x0062): vendor guid,
  merchandise item types, min/max value, deals-magical u32, `BuyPrice` f32
  (the rate the vendor pays us), `SellPrice` f32 (the rate it charges),
  alternate currency wcid, then `u32 amount, string16 plural name` (zero and
  empty without one), `u32 count` and per item `u32 packed (stack & 0xFFFFFF
  | 0xFF << 24)`, then the item as game data only: guid + weenie header
  (the same block ObjectCreate carries after the physics description). Buy
  (0x005F) / Sell (0x0060): vendor, count, `(i32 amount, u32 guid)` pairs,
  u32 alternate currency (0). Prices: charged = max(1, ceil(SellPrice*value
  - 0.1)), paid = max(1, floor(BuyPrice*value + 0.1)). A refused sale comes
  back as InventoryServerSaveFailed for our own guid plus a transient string.
- **Spells.** Using a scroll teaches its spell (weenie header `Spell` u16 on
  the scroll): MagicUpdateSpell (0x02C1: spell id, layer). Casting needs
  ChangeCombatMode 8 (magic), then CastUntargetedSpell (0x0048: spell id) or
  CastTargetedSpell (0x004A: target guid, spell id). The server speaks the
  spell words as our own HearSpeech; failures arrive as WeenieError
  (0x0402 YourSpellFizzled). ACE requires spell components unless
  `require_spell_comps` is false (`@modifybool require_spell_comps false`).

## Magic events (from the ACE source, 2026-09-05; layouts unit-tested, not yet observed live)

- **Spellbook.** MagicUpdateSpell (0x02C1) and MagicRemoveSpell (0x01A8)
  both carry `u16 spell id, u16 layer` (the layer is always 0). The client
  side RemoveSpell action (0x01A8) is a `u32 spell id`. `ac_world::stats`
  keeps `spells` in sync and drops a forgotten spell from every spell bar;
  `ac_client` reports `Event::SpellLearned` / `SpellForgotten`.
- **Enchantment record** (`ac_world::stats::Enchantment`), as in
  PlayerDescription: `u16 spell id, u16 layer, u16 category, u16 has spell
  set, u32 power, f64 start time, f64 duration, u32 caster guid, f32 degrade
  modifier, f32 degrade limit, f64 last degraded, u32 stat mod type, u32
  stat mod key, f32 stat mod value, [u32 spell set id if has spell set]`.
  ACE always writes "has spell set" = 1. Vitae is spell 666 at layer 0.
  `stat mod type` is ACE's EnchantmentTypeFlags: Multiplicative 0x4000,
  Additive 0x8000, Vitae 0x800000, Cooldown 0x1000000, Beneficial
  0x2000000 (set on every buff, clear on debuffs).
- **Enchantment events.** MagicUpdateEnchantment (0x02C2): one record;
  MagicUpdateMultipleEnchantments (0x02C4): `u32 count`, records;
  MagicRemoveEnchantment (0x02C3) and MagicDispelEnchantment (0x02C7):
  `u16 spell id, u16 layer`; MagicRemoveMultipleEnchantments (0x02C5) and
  MagicDispelMultipleEnchantments (0x02C8): `u32 count`, then `(u16 spell
  id, u16 layer)` pairs; MagicPurgeEnchantments (0x02C6): no body, every
  enchantment is gone; MagicPurgeBadEnchantments (0x0312): no body, sent
  on death after the vitae update, the harmful ones are gone (the client
  keeps buffs, vitae and cooldowns). An update with the same spell id and
  layer replaces the record in place; a second layer is a second record.
- **Stack sizes.** A burnt component or a merged vendor stack arrives as
  SetStackSize (0x0197: `u8 sequence, u32 guid, u32 stack size, u32
  value`), which `World` applies to the item; PublicUpdatePropertyInt
  (0x02CE: `u8 sequence, u32 guid, u32 property, i32 value`) with
  StackSize (12) or Value (19) is applied the same way. A stack that hits
  0 is followed by ObjectDelete.
- **Component checks.** ACE maps each component id of the current formula
  to a weenie class through the DualDidMapper 0x27000002 (Lead Scarab 691,
  Prismatic Taper 20631) and counts inventory items of that class; the
  formula without a focus is the SpellTable formula with its taper slots
  (1, 3 and 6 of a 6-8 component spell) rotated per account name
  (`Spell::player_formula`; formula versions 1 to 3), and with the
  school's focus in the packs it is the scarabs (plus chorizite) and 1 to
  4 prismatic tapers by the first scarab's power. `@fillcomps` is one Buy
  (0x005F) listing `(amount, prototype guid)` per short component.

## Selection, target health and fellow vitals (from the ACE source, 2026-09-08)

- **UpdateHealth (0x01C0) follows the selected target.** ACE sends it
  from `Player.HandleActionQueryHealth` when the client sends
  QueryHealth (0x01BF, `u32 guid`; 0 clears) and again from the player
  heartbeat every 5 s while the selected creature lives. Nothing else
  pushes a target's health: without QueryHealth the client only knew a
  creature's health from the ObjectCreate header. `Client::attack` and a
  targeted cast at a creature send it (`Client::query_health`).
- **Fellow vitals need the panel "open".** `Fellowship.OnVitalUpdate`
  sends FellowshipUpdateFellow (0x02C0) only to members whose
  `FellowshipPanelOpen` is set by FellowshipUpdateRequest (0x00A6, `u32
  open`), which also answers with a FellowshipFullUpdate. The client
  sends it once per fellowship as soon as one is described.
- **CancelAttack (0x01B7, no body)** ends the swing chain (AttackDone
  follows) and cancels the server's walk to the target; combat mode
  stays. `Client::cancel_attack`.
- **PlayerKilled (0x019E)** is broadcast for a player's death in view:
  `string16 message, u32 victim, u32 killer`; the client zeroes the
  victim's health and shows the message. Our own death still arrives as
  VictimNotification plus a health update.
- **Property updates.** Public ones carry `u8 seq, u32 guid, u32 key,
  value` (the string one puts the key before the guid and aligns before
  the string); private ones drop the guid. See
  `docs/protocol-coverage.md` for which keys the world applies.
- The audit of every opcode, event and action, with what is handled
  where, is `docs/protocol-coverage.md`.
