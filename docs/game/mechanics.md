# Game mechanics reference

What the game actually does, gathered from the Asheron's Call community
wiki (asheron.fandom.com, September 2026 snapshot), the ACE server source
(read as a specification, never copied) and the client's own DAT tables.
This is the reference for "does the client behave correctly", independent
of how the original UI looked: acswarm's UI may be laid out and improved
freely as long as these rules hold.

Wire opcodes are the GameAction (client to server, `0xF7B1` sub-opcode)
and GameEvent (server to client, `0xF7B0` sub-opcode) numbers from ACE.
`docs/subsystems/net.md` keeps the protocol gotchas found live.

## 1. Magic

### Schools and skills

| School | Skill (formula) | Train / specialize credits | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| War Magic (School of the Arm) | (Focus + Self) / 4; 16 / 12 | bolts, arcs, rings, walls, volleys, blasts, streaks in seven elements |
| Life Magic (Heart) | (Focus + Self) / 4; 12 / 8 | heal/harm/drain vitals, protections and vulnerabilities, regeneration |
| Creature Enchantment (Left Hand) | (Focus + Self) / 4; 8 / 8 | buff/debuff attributes and skills |
| Item Enchantment (Right Hand) | (Focus + Self) / 4; 8 / 8 | weapon/armor/lock enchantments, portal and lifestone tie/recall/summon |
| Void Magic (Shadow) | (Focus + Self) / 4; 16 / 12 | nether damage, curses, corruption over time |
| Summoning | (Endurance + Self) / 3; 8 / 4 | summoning devices, not spells |

Supporting skills: Mana Conversion ((Focus + Self) / 6) reduces mana cost;
Arcane Lore (Focus / 3) activates enchanted items; Magic Defense
((Focus + Self) / 7) resists spells. A spell against a creature is resisted
by comparing the caster's skill with the target's Magic Defense.

### Learning spells and the spellbook

* Spells are learned from **scrolls** (use the scroll; the check is against
  the school's skill, not Arcane Lore) or taught by NPCs. Levels I to VI
  are sold by Scriveners and drop as loot, VII comes only from loot and
  trophies, VIII scrolls are crafted (quill + mana scarab + ink + glyph).
* The server owns the spellbook. It arrives in PlayerDescription (vector
  flag `Spell`: a hash table of spell id → `2.0f`) and changes with
  MagicUpdateSpell (0x02C1: u16 spell id, u16 layer) and MagicRemoveSpell
  (0x01A8: the same two u16s). A player may delete a spell from the book
  with RemoveSpellC2S (0x01A8: u32 spell id).
* Spellbook filters (which schools and levels are shown) are per
  character and stored server side: SpellbookFilter (0x0286) with a
  bitfield Creature 0x1, Item 0x2, Life 0x4, War 0x8, Level1..Level9
  0x10..0x1000, Void 0x2000; the current value comes in PlayerDescription
  (option flag `SpellbookFilters` 0x20).
* Right-clicking a spell shows school, mana, duration, description, the
  components required and the formula. The DAT SpellTable (0x0E00000E)
  has all of it: name, description, school, icon, category (spells of one
  category do not stack, the stronger overrides), base mana, range,
  power (difficulty), component loss (burn rate), meta type, duration,
  the formula (component ids), caster/target/fizzle effects, display
  order and mana mod (extra mana per extra target).

### The spell bar (spell tabs) is not the component list

The **spell bar** holds shortcuts to spells from the spellbook, nothing
else. Facts:

* There are **8 spell bars** (tabs). Each is an ordered list of spell ids.
  The first 9 spells of the shown bar are castable with the number keys
  (`1`..`9`; with a bar open, inventory shortcuts need Ctrl+number).
* Adding a spell: drag it from the book onto the shown bar, or
  double-click it, or drag it onto another tab. Removing: select and press
  Delete. The keys cycle tabs (Insert / Page Up) and spells (Delete /
  Page Down); Ctrl with those jumps to the first or last.
* The bars are **persisted by the server**: AddSpellFavorite (0x01E3:
  spell id, position, bar id) and RemoveSpellFavorite (0x01E4: spell id,
  bar id). Bar ids and positions are 0-based on the wire (ACE rejects bar
  > 7 and unknown spells). All 8 bars arrive in PlayerDescription when
  option flag `SpellLists8` (0x400) is set: 8 × (count u32, spell ids).
  `ac_world::stats::Options::spell_bars` already parses this.
* Casting from the bar selects the spell; the cast goes to the current
  target (or the caster for self spells) via CastTargetedSpell (0x004A:
  target guid, spell id) or CastUntargetedSpell (0x0048: spell id).
* A caster with a built-in spell shows it to the left of the bar; it is
  cast the same way (its id is the caster's `Spell` DID) and never
  fizzles, but costs the item's mana (`ItemManaCost`).

### Magic mode

* Casting needs **magic mode**, which needs a wielded **magic caster**
  (wand, orb, staff, sceptre...). ChangeCombatMode (0x0053) with mode 8
  (Magic); the server reverts to peace if no caster is wielded. Wielding a
  caster while in combat switches to magic mode automatically.
* Defense is highest in any combat stance and lowest in peace mode; trades,
  crafting and (better) healing happen in peace mode.

### Components and foci (consumed by the server, listed in the Components panel)

Spell components live in the inventory as ordinary stackable items. They
are **consumed when a spell is cast**, never by the spell bar. Two systems
coexist:

1. **Full formula** (the original system): each spell's formula is 5 to 8
   components in the order scarab, taper, herb, taper, powder, potion,
   taper, talisman. In the end-of-retail SpellTable 1,296 spells store
   only the five non-taper components (scarab, herb, powder, potion,
   talisman: no tapers at all); the other 4,970 store six to eight, and
   the tapers in slots 1, 3 and 6 are "personal": the client (and ACE's
   `SpellTable.GetSpellFormula`) replaces them with tapers picked by a
   hash of the account name, using the spell's `formula_version` (1, 2
   or 3) to choose the rotation (`Spell::player_formula`). The scarab
   sets the level: Lead I, Iron II, Copper III, Silver IV, Gold V, Pyreal
   VI, Platinum VII, Mana VIII (Diamond, level VI and power 7, and Dark,
   level VII and power 9, lead a few spells; component ids Lead 1, Iron
   2, Copper 3, Silver 4, Gold 5, Pyreal 6, Diamond 110, Platinum 112,
   Dark 192, Mana 193). Lead to Silver come from any mage shopkeeper,
   Gold to Platinum from Mastermages.
2. **Foci** (post-"Castling"): a Focus of Strife (war), Verdancy (life),
   Enchantment (creature), Artifice (item) or Shadow (void) takes a whole
   pack slot and cannot be dropped or sold. With the school's focus in the
   pack, any spell of that school uses the **prismatic formula**: only the
   scarab(s) of the spell (plus Chorizite where the formula has it) and a
   number of **Prismatic Tapers** set by the spell's power: 1 taper for
   power 1, 2 for power 2, 3 for power 3, 4 or 7, 4 for power 5, 6, 8, 9 or
   10. New characters get a focus for every trained school; Scriveners
   sell them; augmentations can remove the need to carry them.

Casting rules (ACE `Player_Magic`, matching retail):

* Before the cast, the server checks that every component of the current
  formula is in the inventory (`require_spell_comps` server option; the
  test server has it off). Missing components fail the cast with
  "You don't have all the components for this spell."
* On a successful cast, **each component may burn**: chance = spell's
  component loss × the component's own destruction modifier (CDM from the
  SpellComponentsTable 0x0E00000F) × min(1, spell power / caster skill).
  Burned ones are removed from the inventory (stack decrement messages)
  and reported in chat as "The spell consumed the following components:
  ...". Scarabs and tapers burn most often; a skilled caster burns fewer.
* The **Components panel** (a tab of the magic panel) lists every
  component currently carried with its count, plus a desired quantity
  0..999 per component (SetDesiredComponentLevel 0x0224; the list comes in
  PlayerDescription under option flag `DesiredComps` 0x8). With a mage
  vendor open, `@fillcomps [type] [max price]` fills the buy list up to
  the desired quantities. A component must already be carried to appear.
* Spell words are spoken by the caster (server sends them as our own
  HearSpeech); they are the components' words in formula order.
* "Peas" are concentrated components that a Splitting Tool turns into
  20 to 50 components.

### Mana, fizzle, timing

* Mana cost = spell base mana (+ mana mod × number of enchantable items
  worn for item-enchantment armor spells, + mana mod × fellows for
  fellowship spells). A trained Mana Conversion skill reduces it with two
  skill checks against half and full difficulty (ACE `GetManaCost`).
  Not enough mana: WeenieError "You don't have enough mana to cast that."
* Fizzle: success chance = 1 / (1 + e^(−0.07 × (skill − power))), and a
  skill more than 50 below the power fails outright. Level VIII spells
  have power 400 (50% at 400 skill, 80% at 420, 99% at 460). A fizzle
  still costs 5 mana, plays the fizzle effect, and reports WeenieError
  0x0402 "Your spell fizzled." Built-in item spells never fizzle.
* Casting war right after void (or void after war) within 3 to 5 s fails
  ("The Elemental energies permeating your blood cause this Void magic to
  fail").
* Cast time is the wind-up gestures (one per non-lead scarab in the
  formula) plus the cast gesture, taken from the caster's motion table in
  the Magic stance; a caster item may replace the cast gesture.
* Target validity: self-targeted spells only on self, non-item spells only
  on creatures, beneficial spells not on monsters, harmful spells on other
  players only under PK rules; the range is the spell's base range
  constant plus range mod × skill.
* A projectile in flight is destroyed by whatever it collides with
  *before* the server asks whether the damage is allowed:
  `SpellProjectile.OnCollideObject` calls `ProjectileImpact()` and only
  then `CheckPKStatusVsTarget`, which refuses the moment either side is a
  non-PK. So a fellow who walks into the line takes nothing and the
  caster loses the spell anyway — a fellowship standing in a huddle
  shoots down its own bolts.

### Enchantments (buffs and debuffs)

* Active spells on the character are the **enchantment registry**, sent
  in PlayerDescription and updated by MagicUpdateEnchantment (0x02C2),
  MagicUpdateMultipleEnchantments (0x02C4), MagicRemoveEnchantment (0x02C3),
  MagicRemoveMultiple (0x02C5), MagicPurgeEnchantments (0x02C6),
  MagicDispel (0x02C7/0x02C8), MagicPurgeBadEnchantments (0x0312). Each
  enchantment: spell id, layer, category, power level, start time,
  duration, caster guid, degrade values, stat mod type/key/value, optional
  spell set id.
* Spells of the same category do not stack; the more powerful overrides.
  Cantrips (item spells) stack with player spells. Life protections that
  stack multiply (65% and 15% give 72%).
* The UI shows beneficial and harmful spells with remaining time; item
  spells have no timer. Vitae is an enchantment too (spell id `Vitae`).
* Level VIII spells last 90 minutes. Some quest and gem spells outrank
  them in power and last 30-60 s (Licorice Leap, Tusker Sprint, Night
  Runner): autoplay wants a buff only if it lasts ten minutes, and one
  spell per effect (stat mod type and key), the one that does most --
  per category the item cantrips (Minor Flame Bane) would all be wanted
  beside the numbered spell for a tenth of its value.

## 2. Combat (melee and missile)

* Three stances: **peace** (dove), **melee/missile combat**, **magic**. The
  combat bar for weapons has a power (melee) or accuracy (missile) slider
  and three attack heights (high, medium, low); the same keys that cycle
  spell tabs and spells change these.
* Power bar: damage 50% at the bottom to 150% at the top; it also picks the
  animation (stab / backhand / slash, punch / jab / kick) and, with
  Recklessness trained, the 10% to 90% band gives +10/+20 damage rating at
  the cost of taking more damage. Missile: −40% attack skill fastest to
  +50% slowest; distance costs up to about 20% skill at maximum range.
* Attack height picks a body zone at random within the zone; front and
  back are distinct (shields protect the front, Sneak Attack rewards rear
  attacks). Dirty Fighting: high attacks weaken healing and attack
  skills, low attacks weaken defense, medium bleed.
* Hit chance compares attacker skill (+ weapon attack modifier, Heart
  Seeker) with the defender's Melee or Missile Defense. Critical hits:
  10% of melee/missile hits double the damage, 5% of spells add half the
  maximum.
* Damage: melee weapons roll between (max − variance) and max, times the
  power modifier, plus a hidden attribute bonus (Strength for heavy,
  light, two-handed and thrown; Coordination for finesse, bow and
  crossbow). Missile damage = ammunition damage × weapon modifier +
  weapon bonus. Elemental weapons and rends, vulnerabilities, slayers and
  creature weaknesses multiply it; ratings add percentages.
* Speed comes from the weapon speed and Quickness; a lower power setting
  attacks faster.
* Stamina: an attack costs stamina scaled by burden and power (roughly 1
  to 6 points), being hit or evading costs 1. At 0 stamina, defenses drop
  to 0 and the character cannot attack.
* Melee attacks charge toward the target first; too far and the attack
  aborts with "You have charged too far!".
* Wire: TargetedMeleeAttack (0x0008: target, height, power),
  TargetedMissileAttack (0x000A: target, height, accuracy; needs combat
  mode 4 Missile, a wielded launcher and ammunition in the ammo slot,
  otherwise the server answers with a weenie error; projectiles that
  meet geometry report "Your missile attack hit the environment";
  verified live), CancelAttack
  (0x01B7); results as AttackerNotification / DefenderNotification
  (0x01B1/0x01B2, damage, part hit, critical), Evasion notifications
  (0x01B3/0x01B4), AttackDone (0x01A7, always with error 0x36 on a normal
  end), VictimNotification / KillerNotification (0x01AC/0x01AD),
  UpdateHealth (0x01C0 for the selected target's health fraction).

### Summoning

* A skill, not a school: the character uses an **essence** carried in the
  pack (ACE `PetDevice`, Use 0x0036), and the creature it names appears in
  front of them, named "<owner>'s <creature>" and carrying the owner's
  guid in its description (WeenieHeaderFlag2 `PetOwner`). It fights the
  nearest enemy until one of them dies or its **lifespan (~45 s)** runs
  out, and is melee only. Summoned creatures neither attack nor can be
  attacked by other players.
* One at a time: while a combat creature is out, another summon is refused
  ("... is already active"). Placement can fail against a wall or slope.
* An essence holds **50 uses** (Structure) and starts a **cooldown of about
  45 s** when used (its CooldownId and CooldownDuration are in the item's
  description). An Encapsulated Spirit refills it to 50.
* Requirements are checked against the **buffed** skill (ACE compares the
  current value): the essence's required Summoning skill (appraisal
  UseRequiresSkillLevel 367, or ItemSkillLevelLimit 115). The number in a
  loot essence's name is the creature's level, **not** the skill: in the
  world database (50) needs 310 (two of them 320), (80) 370, (100) 400,
  (125) 430, (150) 475, (180) 530, and the essences named with no number
  570. Golems (bludgeoning): mud 50, sandstone 220, copper 310, oak 370,
  gold 400, coral 430, iron 475.
* From level 50 a character chooses a mastery at the Arwic statues, which
  unlocks the elemental creatures (acid, fire, frost, lightning) of that
  mastery only: Naturalist (grievvers, moars, phyntos wasps), Necromancer
  (skeletons, spectres, zombies), Primalist (elementals, K'nath, wisps).
  An essence of another mastery is refused. Level 200 creatures carry
  their element in a stronger word (caustic, arctic, galvanic, volcanic...).
* Autoplay: `crate::summoning` (fight setting "summon a creature to
  fight"); the fight rules never pick a creature with a `pet_owner`.

## 3. Character advancement

* **Attributes**: Strength, Endurance, Coordination, Quickness, Focus,
  Self, raised at most 190 points above the creation value (max base 290
  with augmentations). Vitals: Health max = Endurance / 2, Stamina max =
  Endurance, Mana max = Self, each raisable 196 points on its own.
  Regeneration is faster crouching and fastest lying down.
* **Skills** are Unusable (0, cannot be used), Untrained (usable at the
  formula value but cannot be raised), Trained (raised up to 208 points;
  costs skill credits) or Specialized (226 points, +10 bonus, at most 70
  credits' worth). Every skill has a formula from attributes (table in the
  wiki `Skills` page, e.g. Melee Defense (Quickness + Coordination) / 3,
  Run = Quickness, Jump (Strength + Coordination) / 2, Heavy Weapons
  (Strength + Coordination) / 3).
* **Experience** goes to the total and to the **unassigned pool**; the
  player spends it on attributes, vitals and skills. Costs come from the
  XpTable DAT (0x0E000018): attribute, vital, trained-skill and
  specialized-skill cost lists indexed by points raised, the character
  level XP list and the skill credits per level. Level 2 costs 1,000 XP,
  level 10 83,511, level 50 about 55.9 M, level 275 is the cap. Skill
  credits come with levels (one at most levels below 10, then every few
  levels) and from two quests plus two luminance augmentations.
* Wire: RaiseVital (0x0044), RaiseAttribute (0x0045), RaiseSkill
  (0x0046), TrainSkill (0x0047: skill, credits); the server answers with
  private property updates (total XP, unassigned XP, level, skill credits,
  the attribute/skill records) and system chat ("You are now level N!").
* Raising on the wire: the client sends an XP *amount* (RaiseSkill
  0x0046: skill id, xp; RaiseAttribute 0x0045: attribute 1..6, xp;
  RaiseVital 0x0044: MaxHealth 1 / MaxStamina 3 / MaxMana 5, xp) and the
  server adds it to the stat's experience and recomputes the rank, so one
  rank costs `table[ranks + 1] - xp_spent`. TrainSkill (0x0047: skill,
  credits) trains a skill even when the sheet has no record for it yet.
  The server answers with the updated record (PrivateUpdateSkill,
  PrivateUpdateAttribute, PrivateUpdateVital), the new unassigned XP
  (PrivateUpdatePropertyInt64 AvailableExperience) and a chat line ("Your
  base Healing skill is now 38!"). Verified live on ACE.
* **Vitae**: each death adds 5% vitae penalty up to 40%, cutting health,
  stamina, mana and all skills by that percentage. It is an enchantment
  (spell `Vitae`, shown as a status icon). Earning XP recovers 1% at a
  time; no XP is lost. `DeathLevel` and `VitaeCpPool` properties track
  the recovery.
* **Luminance** is a second currency from level 50+ content; ratings
  (damage, damage resist, crit...) come from augmentations, aetheria,
  trinkets and masteries.

### Augmentations

Permanent upgrades bought with experience from augmentation gems (ACE
`AugmentationDevice`; "Might of the Seventh Mule", "Quick Learner"...,
costs of 1 to 4 billion XP as `AugmentationCost`, PropertyInt64 3, which
appraisal shows). Using the gem asks a kind 6 confirmation ("This action
will augment your character with X and will cost N available
experience."); on yes the server checks the XP, the per-type maximum
(innate attributes 10 in all, most others once, carrying capacity 5,
resistances 2 each) and, for skill augmentations, that the skill is
trained, then raises the character property (PropertyInt 218..328),
takes the XP, plays an effect and says "Name has acquired the X
augmentation!". The client lists the ones taken under the skills panel
(`ac_client::augmentations` names them by property) and scripts read
`augmentations()`.

### Character creation and selection

Sources: ACE `ACE.Server/Factories/PlayerFactory.cs` (`Create`,
`ValidateAttributeCredits`, the skill loop, starter gear and spells,
masteries and innate augmentations), `WorldObjects/Player_Skills.cs`
(`TrainSkill`, `SpecializeSkill`, `UntrainSkill`, `AlwaysTrained`,
`AugSpecSkills`), `ACE.Entity/CharacterCreateInfo.cs` (wire layout),
`Network/Handlers/CharacterHandler.cs` (create, enter, delete and restore
handlers and their response codes),
`Network/Enum/CharacterGenerationVerificationResponse.cs`,
`Network/Enum/CharacterError.cs`, `ACE.Server/starterGear.json`, and the
CharGen (0x0E000002) and SkillTable (0x0E000004) DATs
(`ACE.DatLoader/FileTypes/{CharGen,SkillTable}.cs`).

**Choices.** A heritage (ACE `HeritageGroup`: 1 Aluvian, 2 Gharu'ndim, 3
Sho, 4 Viamontian, 5 Shadowbound ("Umbraen" in the DAT), 6 Gearknight, 7
Tumerok, 8 Lugian, 9 Empyrean, 10 Penumbraen, 11 Undead, 12 Olthoi, 13
Olthoi Acid), a sex (1 male, 2 female), an appearance (hair style, hair
colour and shade, eyes, eye colour, nose, mouth, skin shade; headgear,
shirt, pants and footwear style, colour and hue, headgear style
0xFFFFFFFF meaning none), a template, six attributes, an advancement
class for each of 55 skill slots, and a starting town.

**Attributes.** Strength, Endurance, Coordination, Quickness, Focus and
Self are each 10..=100 and their sum may not exceed the heritage's
attribute credits: 330 for every playable heritage (Olthoi 60). A 6 x 100
build is refused; 100/100/100/10/10/10 is exactly the budget, as are the
built-in templates. Vitals follow the attributes (above).

**Skills.** The SkillTable lists 38 skills; the message carries 55 slots
(slot = skill id). Slots the table lacks (0..=5, 8..=13, 17, 25, 26, 42,
53: the retired weapon skills and never-implemented ones) stay 0. Each
slot is an ACE `SkillAdvancementClass`: 0 inactive (the server leaves the
skill as the player weenie has it), 1 untrained (free; usable at the
formula value only when the table's `min_level` is 1), 2 trained, 3
specialized. The budget is 52 skill credits (Olthoi 68). Training costs
the table's `trained_cost`; specializing costs `specialized_cost -
trained_cost` more (the table's second number is the total: Melee Defense
10/20 is "train 10, specialize 10 more"; ACE
`SkillBase.UpgradeCostFromTrainedToSpecialized`). The heritage's CharGen
`skills` list replaces both numbers (`normal_cost` to train,
`primary_cost` extra to specialize); at end of retail the only override
is Arcane Lore 0/2 for every heritage. Costs (train / specialize extra):

| skill | id | cost | skill | id | cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Melee Defense | 6 | 10 / 10 | Missile Defense | 7 | 6 / 4 |
| Arcane Lore | 14 | 0 / 2 (override; table 4 / 2) | Magic Defense | 15 | 0 / 12 |
| Mana Conversion | 16 | 6 / 6 | Item Tinkering | 18 | 2 / no |
| Assess Person | 19 | 2 / 2 | Deception | 20 | 4 / 2 |
| Healing | 21 | 6 / 4 | Jump | 22 | 0 / 4 |
| Lockpick | 23 | 6 / 4 | Run | 24 | 0 / 4 |
| Assess Creature | 27 | 4 / 2 | Weapon Tinkering | 28 | 4 / no |
| Armor Tinkering | 29 | 4 / no | Magic Item Tinkering | 30 | 4 / no |
| Creature Enchantment | 31 | 8 / 8 | Item Enchantment | 32 | 8 / 8 |
| Life Magic | 33 | 12 / 8 | War Magic | 34 | 16 / 12 |
| Leadership | 35 | 4 / 2 | Loyalty | 36 | 0 / 2 |
| Fletching | 37 | 4 / 4 | Alchemy | 38 | 6 / 6 |
| Cooking | 39 | 4 / 4 | Salvaging | 40 | 0 / no |
| Two Handed Combat | 41 | 8 / 8 | Void Magic | 43 | 16 / 12 |
| Heavy Weapons | 44 | 6 / 6 | Light Weapons | 45 | 4 / 4 |
| Finesse Weapons | 46 | 4 / 4 | Missile Weapons | 47 | 6 / 6 |
| Shield | 48 | 2 / 2 | Dual Wield | 49 | 2 / 2 |
| Recklessness | 50 | 4 / 2 | Sneak Attack | 51 | 4 / 2 |
| Dirty Fighting | 52 | 2 / 2 | Summoning | 54 | 8 / 4 |

* **Always trained** (ACE `AlwaysTrained`; `trained_cost` 0 in the table):
  Arcane Lore, Magic Defense, Jump, Run, Loyalty, Salvaging. They are sent
  Trained (2) at no cost and can still be specialized at their extra cost
  (Salvaging excepted). ACE never adds them at login, so a client that
  sent them untrained would get an untrained Run.
* **Cannot be specialized at creation** ("no" above: an extra of 999,
  ACE `AugSpecSkills`): Salvaging and the four tinkering skills; those are
  specialized later by augmentation.
* **Need training to be used** (`min_level` 2): Mana Conversion, Healing,
  Lockpick, the five magic schools, Fletching, Alchemy, Cooking,
  Recklessness, Sneak Attack, Dirty Fighting, Summoning. The rest work
  untrained at their formula value.
* ACE checks skills one by one in id order: `TrainSkill` refuses a cost
  above the credits left (and a skill already Trained), `SpecializeSkill`
  refuses a skill not Trained; any refusal, or an attribute out of
  bounds, answers Corrupt (5). A slot count other than 55 boots the
  session ("your client is not the correct version"). Skills trained at
  creation start with a bonus of 5 ranks (526 xp); specialized ones start
  at 0 ranks with the +10 specialization bonus.

**Templates** (CharGen, per heritage; the index goes on the wire and
names the starting title). The same seven for all eleven playable
heritages, each spending exactly 330 points and 52 credits:

| template | Str/End/Coo/Qui/Foc/Self | trained | specialized |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adventurer | 10/10/10/10/10/10 | (the blank sheet) | |
| Bow Hunter | 40/30/100/100/50/10 | Item Enchantment, Shield | Missile Weapons, Finesse Weapons, Arcane Lore, Melee Defense |
| Swashbuckler | 100/40/100/50/20/20 | Item Enchantment, Healing | Arcane Lore, Melee Defense, Heavy Weapons, Dual Wield |
| Life Caster | 40/50/10/30/100/100 | War Magic, Creature Enchantment, Mana Conversion | Arcane Lore, Life Magic |
| War Mage | 50/40/10/30/100/100 | Life Magic | Mana Conversion, War Magic |
| Wayfarer | 30/30/100/100/60/10 | Melee Defense, Lockpick, Healing, Missile Weapons, Item Enchantment | Finesse Weapons, Dirty Fighting, Dual Wield |
| Soldier | 100/60/100/50/10/10 | Missile Weapons, Healing | Heavy Weapons, Shield, Melee Defense, Dirty Fighting |

Olthoi has one template ("Ripper"), Olthoi Acid one ("Adventurer"), both
all 10s with no skills.

**Starting towns.** CharGen `starter_areas`: 0 Holtburg, 1 Shoushi, 2
Yaraq, 3 Sanamar, 4 OlthoiLair. Each heritage lists its home
(`primary_start_areas`) and the other three it may pick: Aluvian,
Shadowbound, Tumerok, Lugian, Empyrean, Penumbraen and Undead are from
Holtburg; Gharu'ndim and Gearknight from Yaraq; Sho from Shoushi;
Viamontian from Sanamar; the Olthoi only from their lair. ACE puts the
new character at the area's first location (the training academy), sets
the lifestone (`Sanctuary`) there, disables recalls until the academy is
left, and sets the `Instantiation` fallback to the town's "Free Ride"
spell destination (3815 Holtburg, 3813 Shoushi, 3814 Yaraq, 3535
Sanamar).

**Starter gear and spells** (ACE `starterGear.json`, granted for every
skill that is trained or specialized; heritage entries add to the common
list). Through the always-trained Jump everyone gets 10,000 pyreals (one
stack), a Sack, a Calling Stone, a Pathwarden Token, Bread, Ust and a
heritage "Letter From Home" (Gearknights also a Core Plating Integrator
and Deintegrator). Healing: Handy Healing Kit. Lockpick: Crude Lockpick.
Fletching: three bundles of arrowheads and one each of arrowshafts,
atlatl dart shafts and quarrelshafts (30 each). Alchemy: Mortar and
Pestle, three Azurite. Cooking: 6 Flour, 6 Water. Two Handed Combat:
Training Spadone. Shield: Round Shield. Summoning: Mud Golem Essence.
Heavy / Light / Finesse Weapons: one heritage training weapon each (e.g.
Aluvian Dirk / Dagger / Knife, Sho Cestus / Knuckles / Handwraps,
Gharu'ndim Stick / Staff / Bastone, Viamontian Ken / Broad Sword / Short
Sword). Missile Weapons: a Training Shortbow and 250 arrows (Aluvian,
Sho, Empyrean), Training Atlatl and 250 darts (Gharu'ndim, Tumerok,
Lugian, Undead) or Light Training Crossbow and 250 quarrels (Viamontian,
Shadowbound, Gearknight, Penumbraen). A trained Dual Wield doubles every
melee weapon granted. Each magic school trained gives a Training Wand,
the school's Foci (Enchantment, Artifice, Verdancy, Strife, Shadow), 5
Lead Scarabs, 25 Prismatic Tapers and its level I spells: trained gets
the common ones, specialized also the `specializedOnly` ones. Creature
Enchantment: Focus Self, Invulnerability Self/Other (+ Mana Conversion
Mastery Self, Willpower Self). Item Enchantment: Aura of Blood Drinker
Self, Bludgeon Bane, Aura of Swift Killer Self, Impenetrability (+ Aura
of Defender Self, Blade Bane). Life Magic: Armor Self/Other, Heal
Self/Other, Imperil Other (+ Drain Health Other, Harm Other). War Magic:
Flame, Force and Frost Bolt, Shock Wave (+ Acid Stream, Lightning Bolt,
Whirling Blade). Void Magic: Destructive Curse, Corrosion, Corruption,
Nether Bolt (+ Weakening Curse, Nether Streak, Nether Arc, Festering
Curse). Every heritage also gets a melee and a ranged weapon mastery
(Aluvian dagger/bow, Gharu'ndim staff/magic, Sho unarmed/bow, Viamontian
sword/crossbow, ...) and one innate augmentation (Jack of All Trades for
the four original heritages).

**Olthoi.** For heritages 12 and 13 (ACE `IsOlthoiPlayer`) the server
skips clothing, template, attributes, skills, starter gear and spells
entirely: the character is the `olthoiplayer` / `olthoiacidplayer`
weenie with its own stats, spawns in the lair with no Free Ride, gets no
lifestone and no recall lock. With the server's `olthoi_play_disabled`
setting a create answers Pending (2) and an enter answers CharacterError
0x14.

**Names.** ACE checks only the taboo table (NameBanned, 4), the creature
name list when `creature_name_check` is on (also 4) and uniqueness
(NameInUse, 3); it has no length or character rule. The retail client
allowed letters, spaces, hyphens and apostrophes; acswarm's
`creation::valid_name` requires 3..=32 of those with single separators
between letters. Lists show a "+" before the names of admin accounts.

**Wire.** All on the UI queue (9), before the world is entered:

* CharacterCreate 0xF656: account string16, u32 1, heritage, gender; the
  appearance as 14 u32 (eyes, nose, mouth, hair colour, eye colour, hair
  style, headgear style, headgear colour, shirt style, shirt colour, pants
  style, pants colour, footwear style, footwear colour) then 6 f64 hues
  (skin, hair, headgear, shirt, pants, footwear); i32 template; 6 u32
  attributes (Str, End, Coo, Qui, Foc, Self); u32 slot; u32 class id 0;
  u32 55 and 55 u32 advancement classes; name string16; u32 start area;
  u32 isAdmin; u32 isSentinel.
* CharacterCreateResponse 0xF643: u32 code, and on Ok the guid, the name
  string16 and a u32 0. Codes (ACE `CharacterGenerationVerificationResponse`):
  1 Ok, 2 Pending, 3 NameInUse, 4 NameBanned, 5 Corrupt, 6 DatabaseDown, 7
  AdminPrivilegeDenied. After Ok the client enters the world the normal way
  (0xF7C8 CharacterEnterWorldRequest, 0xF7DF ServerReady, 0xF657
  CharacterEnterWorld with guid and account).
* CharacterList 0xF658: u32 0, count, per character guid, name string16
  and u32 seconds until deleted (0, or >0 while a deletion is pending),
  u32 0, u32 slot count (`max_chars_per_account`, 11), account string16,
  u32 use Turbine chat, u32 has Throne of Destiny (1). Sent after login
  and again after a delete.
* CharacterDelete 0xF655: account string16, u32 slot (index in the last
  list). The server echoes an empty 0xF655 and a fresh CharacterList; the
  character is kept for `char_delete_time` (3600 s by default) and then
  purged. Failures are CharacterError 6 (Delete) or 0x15 (world closed).
* CharacterRestore 0xF7D9: u32 guid. Answered by a 0xF643 with (1, guid,
  name, u32 seconds greyed out), or 3 NameInUse if the name was taken
  meanwhile, 5 Corrupt if the save failed, or CharacterError 0xF when the
  deletion already went through.
* CharacterError 0xF659: u32 code (ACE `CharacterError`): 1 Logon, 3
  AccountLogin, 4 and 8 ServerCrash, 5 Logoff, 6 Delete, 9
  AccountInvalid, 0xA AccountDoesntExist, 0xB EnterGameGeneric, 0xC
  StressAccount, 0xD CharacterInWorld, 0xE PlayerAccountMissing, 0xF
  CharacterNotOwned (also for a character pending deletion), 0x10
  CharacterInWorldServer, 0x11 OldCharacter (back to the select screen),
  0x12 CorruptCharacter, 0x13 StartServerDown, 0x14
  CouldntPlaceCharacter, 0x15 LogonServerFull (world closed, or shutting
  down), 0x17 CharacterLocked, 0x18 SubscriptionExpired.

In acswarm: `ac_client::creation` (`rules`, `Rules`, `CharacterBuild`,
`valid_name`, `create_failure_message`), `Client::{create_character,
enter_world, delete_character, restore_character}`, the events
`Characters`, `CharacterCreated` and `CharacterCreateFailed`, and
`Config::auto_enter` (off, with no character named, the client shows the
list instead of entering). Headless: `acswarm --headless --create NAME`
with `--heritage`, `--gender`, `--template`,
`--start-area`; `--show-rules` prints a heritage's credits and costs.

## 4. Death and corpses

* On death the character resurrects at the last **lifestone attuned**
  (use a lifestone to attune; it drains half the stamina). Death costs
  half the pyreals (none below level 6), a number of items (none below 11;
  1 for 11 to 20; level / 20 + 0..2 above; the highest-value items drop
  first, same-type items counted at half value after the first; bonded
  items never drop; rares always drop) and 5% vitae.
* The corpse holds the dropped items, is locked to the owner unless the
  player `@permit`s someone or is a PK, and decays after level × 5 minutes
  (at least 1 hour) while its landblock is loaded; then the items fall on
  the ground. ACE destroys the dropped pyreals outright by default
  (`corpse_destroy_pyreals`), so the corpse only holds the items.
* On the wire a death is VictimNotification 0x01AC ("You killed
  yourself", "Drudge killed you"), the vitae as MagicUpdateEnchantment
  (spell 666, `stat_mod_value` 0.95 for 95%), then MagicPurgeEnchantments
  and, after the death animation, the "You've lost 223 Pyreals, and your
  Iron Scarab!" system line and the teleport to the lifestone. The purge
  keeps the vitae: the client holds it in its own registry slot.
* Verified on ACE with a headless session: suicide, corpse listed and opened at the
  death spot, item taken back, vitae shown, lifestone attune ("You have
  attuned your spirit to this Lifestone...").
* `/lifestone` (`/ls`) recalls to the attuned lifestone alive (long
  animation: TeleToLifestone 0x0063); `/die` kills the character. Item
  Enchantment adds Lifestone Tie / Recall / Sending and Portal Tie /
  Recall / Summon.
* Player Killer status (red) allows attacking other PKs and makes corpses
  lootable; PK Lite (pink) is PvP without death penalties.
* **A monster's corpse** lasts five minutes (ACE's default TimeToRot,
  started at its first heartbeat) and belongs to whoever landed the
  killing blow. It opens to everyone else once it has half rotted --
  under the 180 s HalfLife, so two minutes after it fell -- or, long
  before that, the moment anyone who could open it closes it again:
  `Corpse.Close` sets IsLooted unconditionally and `HasPermission`
  answers on IsLooted before it ever reads the clock, so the killer
  opening a body and closing it makes it everyone's within seconds. Or
  at once to a fellowship with loot sharing on. Until then an open is
  answered with a transient string,
  "You do not yet have the right to loot the {name}."; a body that made
  a rare, or one from a player killer's death, is never shared and says
  "You may not loot the {name} because ...". A container the server has
  already given to one viewer refuses every other with "The {name} is
  already in use by someone else!" -- one viewer at a time, no queue.
  These are the server's whole answer to an open: there is no error code
  with them.

## 5. Inventory, items, burden

* The **main pack** holds 102 items; up to 7 side packs (24 items
  typically) plus one more with an augmentation. Foci take a whole slot.
* Equipment slots: head, chest, upper/lower arms, hands (gauntlets),
  girth (abdomen), upper/lower legs, feet; shirt, pants; necklace, two
  bracelets, two rings; cloak, trinket; weapon, shield or off-hand weapon
  (Dual Wield), ammunition; aetheria at 75/150/225.
* **Burden**: capacity = Strength × 150 units at 100%. Over 100% Run,
  Jump, Melee and Missile Defense drop 10% per 10% over; at 200% no
  jumping and walking drains stamina; 300% is the hard cap.
* **Jumping** is charged: holding the jump key fills a bar (a second to
  full) and releasing it leaps with that power. The client computes the
  launch velocity itself and sends Jump 0xF61B (power, local velocity,
  sequences); height = burden mod × (Jump skill / (skill + 1300) × 22.2
  + 0.05) × power, at least 0.35 m, and the horizontal speed at take-off
  is kept in the air. Stamina cost = ceil((burden + 0.5) × power × 8 +
  2) (PK: (power + 1) × 100); the server deducts it and would send the
  character falling anyway, so the client caps the power at
  (stamina − 2) / (burden × 8 + 4) and refuses below 2 stamina.
* Moving items: DropItem (0x001B: item) puts a carried item on the
  ground in front of the character (the server answers with
  InventoryPutObjectIn3D and creates the object); PutItemInContainer
  (0x0019: item, container, placement) moves it into the main pack (the
  player's own guid), a carried side pack, or a chest the player is
  looking into (a closed or locked chest answers WeenieError 0x03EE "The
  container is closed"; corpses refuse); GiveObjectRequest (0x00CD:
  target, item, amount) hands it to an NPC (which answers with an emote
  or refuses with InventoryServerSaveFailed) or a player ("You give X 50
  Iron Scarabs" / "X gives you 50 Iron Scarabs"; the receiver must allow
  gifts in their character options and be within reach).
* Picking up: `R` on an object, `F` moves the selected item into the
  preferred pack (the last opened pack, or the main pack). Stacks:
  StackableMerge 0x0054 (from, to, amount) moves part or all of one
  stack into another of the same weenie (capped at the target's maximum
  stack size, the WeenieDesc's MaxStackSize; the rest stays),
  StackableSplitToContainer 0x0055 (stack, container, placement, amount)
  makes a new stack in a pack, StackableSplitTo3D 0x0056 (stack, amount)
  drops part of one, StackableSplitToWield 0x019B (stack, EquipMask,
  amount) wields part (ammo). The server answers with the new object and
  SetStackSize / InventoryServerSaveFailed ("Split amount not valid!").
  In the client: right-click a stack in the pack for a split slider,
  drag a stack onto another of its kind to merge; scripts `split(guid,
  n)` and `merge(from, to)`.
* **Shortcut slots**: 9 numbered slots at the bottom of the inventory
  panel, one item each, used with the number keys (Ctrl+number while a
  spell bar is up). Persisted server side: AddShortCut (0x019C) /
  RemoveShortCut (0x019D); the list arrives in PlayerDescription under
  option flag `Shortcut` 0x1. Putting the main pack in a slot means "use
  on self", so kit-then-pack heals.
* Appraising (IdentifyObject 0x00C8 → IdentifyObjectResponse 0x00C9)
  shows value and burden, description, special properties, spells and
  spellcraft, mana and mana rate, activation and wield requirements,
  armor level and per-damage-type protections, weapon damage / speed /
  modifiers, and for creatures and players level, attributes, allegiance,
  titles and armor levels.
* **Using things in the world**: retail had two actions on the selected
  object, "Use Selected" (Use 0x0036: read a book where it lies, open a
  chest, talk to an NPC) and picking up (PutItemInContainer into the
  pack), besides double-click which picks a loose item up and uses
  anything else. The client keeps all three: double-click, R to use in
  place, G to pick up; scripts `activate(guid)` and `pickup(guid)`. Books,
  signs and plaques answer Use with BookDataResponse 0x00B4: the book
  guid, max pages, page count, max characters per page, then each page's
  scribe id, name, account, flags, a text-included flag, an ignore-author
  flag and the text when included (never in this event on ACE), then the
  inscription (the title) and the scribe. BookPageData 0x00AE (guid, page
  index) fetches one page as BookPageDataResponse 0x00B8 (guid, index,
  the page with its text). A carried book is read the same way by using
  it, or with BookData 0x00AA (guid). The client shows the book window
  with Prev/Next, fetching pages as they are turned to; scripts read
  `book()` and `read_page(i)`.
* **Appraisal** (IdentifyObject 0x00C8 on selecting; IdentifyObjectResponse
  0x00C9): a flags word, success, then by flag the int, int64, bool,
  float, string and data-id property tables (PackableHashTables of id,
  value), the spell id list, the armor profile (8 f32 multipliers of the
  armor level per damage type), the creature profile (flags, health and
  max; with flag 8 the six attributes and stamina, mana and their maxima;
  with flag 1 the buff/debuff marks), the weapon profile (damage type
  bits, speed, skill, damage, variance, damage mod, length, max
  velocity, offense multiplier, estimated range), the hook profile, the
  enchantment highlight/colour masks for armor, weapon and resistances,
  and a creature's armor by location. The client keeps every appraisal
  by guid and shows the latest in the appraisal window; scripts read it
  with `appraisal(guid)`. Verified live on a healing kit, a lifestone
  (its Use text) and a barkeeper (level, health).
* Giving and using-on are different actions: GiveObjectRequest 0x00CD
  hands an item to an NPC or player, UseWithTarget 0x0035 applies a
  healing kit, mana stone, key or lockpick to a target (the item's
  Usable word says which: target bits above 0xFFFF, 0x20000 self). Retail dragged
  an item onto someone to give it and used a kit on someone by selecting
  them and using the kit; the client does the same (with nothing
  selected the server applies the kit to yourself).
* **Single-step crafting** is one item used on another: the client sends
  UseWithTarget 0x0035 and the server looks the pair up in its recipe
  book (source weenie + target weenie -> a recipe), so the same action
  covers a carving knife on a pumpkin, an alembic on a reagent, an oil
  on a weapon and a salvage bag on one. The character must be in peace
  mode, a recipe may need a trade skill ("You are not trained in that
  trade skill") and, when the crafting-chance option is on, the server
  asks for confirmation first. In the inventory this is "Use on..."
  from an item's right-click menu, then a click on the other item.
  Verified live: a Carving Knife on a Pumpkin became a Jack o' Lantern.
* Mana stones charge wielded items; healing kits heal (Healing skill,
  difficulty = missing health × 2, harder in combat, 1 stamina per 5
  health); potions and food restore vitals.
* **Salvaging**: using the Ust (wcid 20646) opens the salvage window
  client-side; the server only hears CreateTinkeringTool 0x027D (tool
  guid, count, item guids). It skips items without a material or a
  workmanship (vendor stock) and retained ones, destroys the rest and
  merges them into salvage bags per material ("Salvaged Oak", one bag
  per 100 units; `Structure` counts the units, `ItemWorkmanship` their
  average), then answers SalvageOperationsResult 0x02B4 per skill used:
  skill id, guids it could not salvage, (material, workmanship f64,
  units) per material, augmentation bonus percent. Units per item are
  1 + floor(skill / 194 × workmanship), with the Salvaging skill or the
  best trained tinkering skill, whichever yields more (tinkering skills
  are capped at the workmanship). The item's material and workmanship
  travel in the WeenieDesc (flags 0x80000000 and 0x1000000), so the
  client knows what is salvageable without appraising. The bags are
  made afresh for each salvage: everything of one material salvaged
  together shares a bag and its averaged workmanship, a bag already
  carried is never added to, and skill changes only how many units come
  out, never their workmanship. So a workmanship 9 or 10 item belongs
  only in a salvage of its own workmanship; acswarm's autoplay salvages
  everything below 9 together, then the 9s, then the 10s, a batch each.
* **Giving between players**: GiveObjectRequest 0x00CD hands a carried
  item (or part of a stack) to a player in use range. ACE refuses it
  unless the receiver's `CharacterOptions1.AllowGive` ("Let other
  players give you items") is on, answering "X is not accepting gifts right now",
  so a character that is to receive anything must have the option set
  (the team rules set it for every teammate). Retained and attuned
  items cannot be given. acswarm's autoplay uses this to carry loot
  tagged for salvage to the teammate with the highest Salvaging skill
  and an Ust (see `docs/multi-session.md`).
* **Tinkering**: UseWithTarget 0x0035 with a salvage bag on an item. The
  server finds the recipe (material × item kind), computes the chance
  from the tinkering skill against the difficulty, and with the
  "crafting chance dialog" option on asks a kind 5 confirmation ("You
  determine that you have a 38 percent chance to succeed."); yes applies
  it: success raises the item's tinkered property and its tinker count
  (10 max), failure destroys the bag. Untrained skills answer "You are not
  trained in Weapon Tinkering." A bag must be full (100 units, its
  `Structure` equal to `MaxStructure`) or the recipe requirement answers
  "The material is not complete!". Salvage bags are also the ingredient
  of other recipes (keys, tokens) through the same use-on path. The
  server sends "Salvage (n)" as the bag's name; the client shows
  "Salvaged Iron (n)" from the material and structure, as retail did.
* Verified on ACE: three Rusted Maces salvaged with an Ust into
  "Salvaged Iron (6)" ("You obtain 6 Iron (workmanship 3.00) using your
  Weapon Tinkering skill."), the salvaged items removed by
  InventoryRemoveObject 0x0024 (a top-level message the client now
  handles; spent, given and corpse-dropped items use it, not
  DeleteObject); a full bag on a mace asked "You determine that you have
  a 21 percent chance to succeed." and on yes "+Admin fails to apply the
  Iron Salvage (workmanship 3.00) to the Iron Rusted Mace. The target is
  destroyed." Items the server cannot add to the pack (burden over
  three times 150 × Strength) are silently not created by `@ci`.

## 6. Vendors, trade, pyreals

* Vendors: approach (Use) → ApproachVendor/VendorInfoEvent (0x0062) with
  the stock and the buy/sell rates; Buy (0x005F) and Sell (0x0060). ACE
  names: BuyPrice is what the vendor pays, SellPrice what it charges;
  values are rounded as in `docs/subsystems/net.md`. Trade notes are
  currency items; pyreals stack to 25,000.
* Secure trade between players (verified live): double-click a player
  (the retail client sent OpenTradeNegotiations 0x01F6 itself; the server
  ignores Use on players). Both must be in peace mode and close by.
  RegisterTrade (0x01FD: initiator, partner, i64 stamp) opens the window
  for both; AddToTrade (0x01F8: item, slot) puts an item in, echoed as
  AddToTrade (0x0200: item, side 1 = own / 2 = partner, slot) to both;
  RemoveFromTrade (0x0201); AcceptTrade (0x01FA: partner, stamp as f64,
  status, initiator, initiator accepts, partner accepts; the server only
  needs it to arrive) answered by AcceptTrade (0x0202: who) plus "You
  have accepted the offer" / "X has accepted the offer"; when both have
  accepted the server swaps the items ("The items are being traded"),
  resets the window (ResetTrade 0x0205) and keeps it open. DeclineTrade
  (0x01FB / 0x0203), ResetTrade (0x0204 / 0x0205), CloseTradeNegotiations
  (0x01F7) / CloseTrade (0x01FF: reason 1 normal, 2 entered combat, 0x51
  cancelled), TradeFailure (0x0207: item, WeenieError, e.g. attuned),
  ClearTradeAcceptance (0x0208) after any change.
* Giving: GiveObjectRequest (0x00CD: target, item, amount) to NPCs or
  players.

## 7. Social systems

* **Fellowship** (verified live): up to 9 members; XP shared equally
  when all are within 5 levels of the founder (or all 50+),
  proportionally within 10 levels, with a group bonus (2 members 75%
  each, 3 60%, 9 30%); optional loot sharing. FellowshipCreate (0x00A2:
  name, share xp) answers with FellowshipFullUpdate (0x02BE: hash-table
  header u16 count/u16 buckets, then per fellow guid, cp, luminance,
  level, max health/stamina/mana, current health/stamina/mana, share
  loot, name; then name, leader, share xp, even share, open, locked,
  departed members, locks). FellowshipRecruit (0x00A5: guid) sends the
  target a ConfirmationRequest (0x0274: type 4 Fellowship, context,
  text) unless their character options ignore fellowship requests (the
  retail default; "X is not accepting fellowship requests");
  ConfirmationResponse (0x0275: type, context, yes) joins, and everyone
  gets FellowshipUpdateFellow (0x02C0: fellow record + update type).
  FellowshipQuit (0x00A3: disband) / FellowshipDismiss (0x00A4: guid)
  echo as events with the guid; FellowshipDisband (0x02BF) ends it.
  Members are green radar blips (leader triangle up).
* **Allegiance**: a tree of patrons and vassals under a monarch. Swear
  by selecting a player and sending SwearAllegiance 0x001D (their guid):
  the server walks you within 2 m, asks the patron with a kind 1
  confirmation whose text is just your name, and on yes tells both sides
  in chat ("Reborn has sworn Allegiance to you." / "+Admin has accepted
  your oath of Allegiance!"), plays the kneel motion and sends both an
  AllegianceUpdate 0x0020 then AllegianceUpdateDone 0x01C8. Refused when
  you already have a patron ("You've already sworn allegiance."), the
  patron ignores allegiance requests (character option 1), has 11
  vassals, is banned/locked, or is your own vassal. BreakAllegiance 0x001E
  (the patron's or a vassal's guid) drops the link from either side
  ("You have broken your Allegiance to X!" / "X has broken their
  Allegiance to you!").
* The profile is only sent on request (AllegianceUpdateRequest 0x001F,
  the client sends one once placed and when the panel opens): our rank,
  member and vassal counts, then the hierarchy (officers hash table,
  officer titles, broadcast counters, motd and who set it, chat room id,
  bind point, name, lock, approved vassal) and member records for the
  monarch, the patron if not the monarch, ourselves if not the monarch,
  and our direct vassals, each with rank, level, loyalty, leadership,
  online flag, XP generated/cached and a "may pass up" flag. The rest of
  the tree is never sent. AllegianceInfoRequest 0x027B (a name; officers
  only) answers with AllegianceInfoResponse 0x027C for that member;
  AllegianceLoginNotification 0x027A flips a member's online flag.
* **XP passup**: a vassal's earned XP (kills, quests; not admin grants)
  generates 50%+ for the patron by Loyalty and the patron receives by
  Leadership, but only when the patron's level was at least the vassal's
  when the oath was sworn (`ExistedBeforeAllegianceXpChanges`; the record
  shows it as the "no passup" flag). Rank is 1 + the vassal count ladder,
  capped at 10.
* Names and motd: SetAllegianceName 0x0033 / ClearAllegianceName 0x0031
  (monarch: "Your allegiance name has been set.", no profile resent, so
  the client asks for one), SetMotd 0x0254 / ClearMotd 0x0256 (officers).
  Group chat is ChatChannel 0x0147 (channel id, text): Vassals 0x1000,
  Patron 0x2000, Monarch 0x4000, CoVassals 0x01000000, Fellow 0x800, which
  everyone on the channel, sender included, gets back as ChannelBroadcast
  0x0147 (channel, sender or "" for yourself, text); `/v`, `/p`, `/m`,
  `/c`, `/f` in the chat box.
* **Emotes**: `/e text` is a free emote (Emote 0x01DF, shown to everyone
  near as "Name text" via EmoteText 0x01E0). Soul emotes are the animated
  ones: typing `*wave*` (retail) or `/wave` looks the word up in the
  emote table, plays the motion locally, sends it in the next MoveToState
  as a one-shot command (the command list length sits above the 11 flag
  bits; each item is the raw command (MotionCommand & 0xFFFF), a packed
  sequence with the autonomous bit, and speed 1.0, the only speed ACE
  accepts, and only for the motions in its `SoulEmote` list), and says
  the line with SoulEmote 0x01E1 (text), which comes back to everyone
  near as message 0x01E2 (guid, name, text) shown "Name waves". The
  server relays the command in the UpdateMotion others get, so they play
  the animation. The client's table (`ac_client::emotes`) holds about
  seventy words; verified with two sessions (wave, bow deep).
* **Friends, titles, squelch**: AddFriend 0x0018 (name) / RemoveFriend
  0x0017 (guid) / RemoveAllFriends 0x0025 answer with FriendsListUpdate
  0x0021 (count, records of guid, online flag, appear-offline flag,
  name, two empty guid lists; then the kind: 0 full list at login, 1
  added, 2 removed, 4 online status changed). Titles: CharacterTitle
  0x0029 at login (1, shown id, count, ids); TitleSet 0x002C (id) picks
  one and UpdateTitle 0x002B (id, shown flag) confirms or grants a new
  one ("You have been granted a new title."); names come from the
  portal EnumMapper 0x22000041. Squelch: ModifyCharacterSquelch 0x0058
  (flag, guid, name), ModifyAccountSquelch 0x0059 (flag, name),
  ModifyGlobalSquelch 0x005B (flag, ChatMessageType); the server drops
  the squelched player's lines before they reach us and re-sends
  SetSquelchDB 0x01F4 (account table, character table of guid to
  filter masks, name, account flag; global mask).
* **Turbine chat** (message 0xF7DE, not a game event) carries the rooms:
  General 2, Trade 3, LFG 4, Roleplay 5, the society rooms 6..9, Olthoi
  10, and each allegiance's own room whose id is the allegiance's biota
  id (SetTurbineChatChannels 0x0295 lists the ten room ids at login and
  after an oath; the "You have entered the General channel" lines are
  WeenieErrorWithString). A message is a net blob: size, blob type (1 a
  line from a room, 3 our request, 5 the server's ack), dispatch type,
  (1, id, 1, id, 0), payload size, then for a room line the room id, the
  sender and the text as counted UTF-16 strings, 0x0C, sender guid, 0,
  chat type; for our request the context id, 2, 2, room id, text, 0x0C,
  our guid, 0, chat type. The server relays a line to everyone whose
  "listen to" option for that room is on, the sender included, and
  answers the request with an ack blob. `/g`, `/trade`, `/lfg`, `/rp`
  and `/a` in the chat box; lines show as "[General] Name: text".
  Verified with two sessions on ACE in all three public rooms.
* Verified on ACE with two headless sessions: swear + confirmation, both
  profiles, naming, `/p` and `/v` chat both ways, break from the vassal.
* **Commands**: the server (ACE `GameActionTalk`) treats only Talk lines
  starting with `@` as commands (`@acehelp`, `@myquests`, admin commands;
  unknown ones answer "Unknown command: X"). Retail's `/` commands were
  the client's own and map to game actions: `/lifestone` (`/lif`, `/ls`)
  TeleToLifestone 0x0063 (refused with WeenieError 0x055D while
  `RecallsDisabled` is set: from character creation until the Training
  Academy's exit portal is used), `/die` Suicide 0x0279, `/house` (`/hou`)
  TeleToHouse 0x0262, TeleToMansion 0x0278, RecallAllegianceHometown 0x02AB,
  `/marketplace` (`/mar`, `/mp`) 0x028D, `/pklite` (`/pkl`)
  EnterPkLite 0x028F, `/afk [message]` SetAfkMessage 0x0010 + SetAfkMode
  0x000F, `/tell Name, text` (`/t`, `/send`, `/whisper`, `/w`) Tell 0x005D
  (text, name), `/emote text` (`/e`, `/em`, `/me`) Emote 0x01DF. acswarm
  answers the ones its table has a row for, offers the rest to the plugins
  and scripts, then sends them as `@command` (`Client::chat_line`).
* **Character options**: two bitfields in PlayerDescription
  (CharacterOptions1/2), changed with SetSingleCharacterOption (0x0005:
  option id from ACE `CharacterOption`, value); "ignore fellowship
  requests", "auto-repeat attacks", "let others give you items" and the
  chat channels among them. New characters ignore fellowship requests by
  default.
* **Chat**: local (`@say`, emotes), `@tell` (Tell 0x005D, events Tell
  0x02BD), fellowship and allegiance channels, global channels General,
  Trade, LFG, Roleplay, Society (`@cg`, `@ct`, `@clfg`; `/join` and
  `/leave`; ChatChannel 0x0147 and the Turbine chat messages), plus
  System, Combat, Magic and Advancement message types that the UI can
  route to separate windows. Squelch lists filter characters or accounts.
* **Radar** blip colours: white other players, yellow NPCs, orange
  attackable creatures, purple portals, blue lifestones, red PKs, pink PK
  Lite, green fellows, dimmed when above or below; hollow squares for
  allegiance members.

## 8. Travel

* **Portals** are used by walking into them (collision) or Use; the server
  sends PlayerTeleport (0xF751) then the new position, and the client
  shows portal space (a short tunnel effect, `Portal_Space`) before the
  new landblock. Some have level or quest restrictions ("You are not
  powerful enough to use this portal").
* **Dungeons have no outside.** Every collision triangle of a dungeon
  block carries its cell id, including the objects placed in cells and
  the block-level ones (portals, grates), and while the character stands
  in a dungeon cell an untagged floor keeps the current cell and the
  terrain never catches a fall. Before this, standing on a door sill or a
  staircase (untagged geometry) re-homed the character to the outdoor
  cell under the dungeon and ACE refused every move afterwards
  ("movement pre-validation failed from 012F010C ... to 012E0009").
* **One-sided walls hold only from the front.** Cell structures model
  each wall as two one-sided polygons, an inner face and an outer face.
  A one-sided face pushes the capsule out only when the move started in
  front of it, and a move that would cross a face from its front is
  refused outright; before this the outer face pushed the character
  through the wall (or, jammed between a wall and a staircase railing a
  body width away, the alternating pushes did), after which a jump in
  the Holtburg meeting hall (0x0125) fell out of the building forever:
  "stuck in the air" in the client. `cargo run -p ac-client --example
  jump_scan BLOCK` runs jumps from every standing spot of a dungeon and
  lists the ones that never land (`SLOPES=1` includes stairs);
  `jump_trace CELL x y z heading` follows one frame by frame, and
  `ac-scene --example tris_near BLOCK x y z r` lists the collision
  triangles around a point with the pushes they apply.
* **A wall's edge pushes away from the edge.** Passing the end of a
  wall (Arwic's gate posts), the nearest point of a one-sided triangle
  to the capsule is its edge; pushing along the face normal there held
  the walker still against the post every frame. When the nearest point
  is an edge and the capsule is in front of the plane, the push goes
  away from the edge instead.
* **Routes keep a margin, and corners are not cut.** String-pulling a
  lattice route pulls it tight round every corner it turns, and the
  walker (0.7 m arrival radius) cut those corners into the wall. The
  smoothing now walks its shortcuts with the radius plus 0.3 m (the
  lattice points stay where there is no room, so a body-wide doorway
  still passes), and a waypoint is passed early only when the line to
  the next one is open.
* **"No progress" is measured along the route.** The travel layer
  skipped a waypoint after 8 s without coming closer to it as the crow
  flies, so a legitimate detour round a town wall looked stuck, the
  waypoint was skipped and the next one aimed back at the wall: that
  was the run-at-the-wall-and-back oscillation. Progress is now the
  remaining length of the route being steered (re-based when the route
  changes; the clock keeps running, so a character that does not move
  is still caught), reaching a waypoint counts as progress for the
  step, and a step whose last waypoint cannot be reached is planned
  again from where the character stands rather than called arrived.
  `cargo run --release -p ac-client --example walksim BLOCK x y g
  GOAL_BLOCK gx gy` walks a character offline with the real steering
  and physics (no server) and reproduces these in under a minute.
* **Never aim at a point behind the walker.** A leg that crosses a
  landblock boundary is steered at the point where it leaves the block,
  pulled 3 m back inside so the block's graph has somewhere to stand. A
  walker standing a stride short of the edge (a character coming off a
  portal or a save at the edge -- Rawr II outside Arwic) was aimed 2 m
  behind itself and stepped back and forward for ever. The point has to
  be a stride ahead, otherwise the goal itself is the aim.
* **Run and Jump come from the sheet.** The run speed is the run
  animation's pace times the server's run rate for the Run skill (ACE
  `MovementSystem.GetRunRate`: 1 at nothing, 2.4 at 200, 4.5 from 800);
  the jump height is `GetJumpHeight` with the Jump skill (id 22 -- not
  4, which is Dagger, as the client once had it). The server refuses a
  move only when it is both more than 50 m from the last it accepted and
  more than a landblock away, so it does not hold a character to its
  run rate; other players' clients animate the character at that rate.
  This client can go past either -- twice the run rate and a 9 m full
  jump ("run speed ×" and "full jump, m" in the Options panel,
  `speed_boost`/`jump_height` in scripts; the skill's own height wins
  when it is more) -- but only where the server allows it. The rise is
  capped at 9.5 m: the server calls a character found more than 10 m
  above the ground it last stood on, a second after a jump, a
  z-position hack and puts it back. See "movement rules" below for when
  the extras apply at all.
* **The server takes the client's word for where it is.** ACE runs
  its own physics on each reported position only to notice what was
  touched (portals, creatures); it does not push the character out of
  walls or apply gravity, and the "on the ground" byte the client sends
  with every position is what sets `LastGroundPos`, the yardstick for
  its one height check (more than 10 m above it, a second after a jump,
  with Jump under 1000, is a "z-pos hack" and the character is put
  back). A client that always says it is on the ground, as this one
  does, can fly. What ACE refuses: a move both 50 m from the last it
  accepted and more than a landblock away; crossing straight from one
  dungeon block to another, or from a building's interior cell to
  another building's in a different landblock. So the viewer's Y key
  flies (Space up, Control down, Y again drops onto whatever is below;
  F is the fellowship panel and every other letter is taken), and
  scripts have `noclip(true|false)`.
* **Only on a server that allows it: the movement rules.** Taking the
  client's word for a position is not the same as agreeing with it.
  ACE still runs its own physics on every position reported
  (`update_object_server`), so a character flown into a wall is held at
  the wall on the server while this screen shows it through; a jump
  higher than the Jump skill's is force-corrected as a z-pos hack; and
  everything the server decides by where *it* thinks the character is
  -- casting, looting, every range check -- then refuses what looks from
  here like a fair try. So the client holds itself to the game's own
  rules unless the server is its own. "Movement rules" in the Options
  panel (`Client::movement_rules`, `player::MovementRules`) has three
  settings: Automatic (the default: the extras only when connected to a
  loopback host, `127.0.0.1`, `::1` or a `localhost` name),
  Server-safe, and Unrestricted. Server-safe holds `speed_boost` at
  1.0, adds nothing to the Jump skill's own height, and refuses
  `set_noclip(true)` (which returns false and says why). The limits
  live on the `Player` (`MovementLimits`) and default to the safe ones,
  so a character nobody tells stays inside the rules.
* **A building's door can open onto bare terrain** (a villa's grounds:
  cell 6F8B015F at Loredane Villas). Leaving the interior floor with
  nothing but terrain a step away must go outdoors; before this the
  character kept the cell and walked a kilometre "inside" it, reporting
  a cell and a position that no longer matched. ACE then refuses every
  move whose distance from its own idea of the position is more than a
  block and faster than a run (`MOVEMENT SPEED` in the server log) and
  never tells the client, so a portal the client walks into "would not
  take us" and the trip planner, told the character was indoors, found
  no way anywhere. When a portal refuses for no reason, read the server
  log.
* **Collision comes from physics polygons only.** A cell structure's
  drawn polygons include its portals (the openings to the next cell);
  the two cell structures in the data without physics polygons are air
  cells whose every face is a portal, such as the space above the
  meeting hall's balcony. Building their drawn faces instead put an
  invisible floor and four invisible walls six metres above the hall,
  and a jump from the balcony or the stair top ended standing on it,
  boxed in: "stuck at the floor's level in the air above the stairs".
  `ac-scene --example env_survey` counts such cells.
* **One terrain surface.** Each terrain cell is two triangles, and which
  diagonal splits it comes from the original's hash of the block and cell
  coordinates (`terrain::split_dir`): true cuts from the lower right to
  the top left, false from the lower left to the top right. The physics
  sampler used the opposite diagonal from the drawn mesh, so on any cell
  whose four corners are not level the character walked at a height the
  ground was not drawn at, and a jump off a Holtburg hill ended metres
  under it. A test now checks the two agree over four landblocks, and
  `ac-client --example fall_scan BLOCK` jumps from a grid of spots and
  reports any ending below the ground.
* **Terrain is the last resort outdoors.** A falling character is caught
  by the terrain unless they are in a dungeon or standing on an interior
  floor. A character who walks out of a building still carries its cell
  id, so "indoors" alone must not stop the catch: with no floor under
  them at all the terrain takes them, while a cellar's own floor still
  wins.
* **Landing and headroom.** A falling character lands on any floor up
  to a step (0.6 m) above its feet, so a jump that arrives a few
  centimetres under a ledge's top stands on the ledge instead of passing
  through the slab; and while airborne the capsule may only drift to
  spots with full headroom, so it cannot slide under a porch or a
  staircase on the way down. Both came from a jump at the Shoushi
  tailor's porch that ended in the one-metre gap beneath it, blocked in
  every direction; `cargo run -p ac-client --example jump_probe` scans
  jumps from a spot, and `tests/jump.rs` keeps that porch honest.
* **Map coordinates**: the game's "42.1N, 33.6E" is the world position
  (landblock × 192 m + local) divided by 240 minus 102 on both axes,
  north and east positive, a twentieth taken off before rounding to a
  tenth; indoor cells (0x100 and up) have none. The status line shows
  them; scripts read `me().coords`.
* **Overland travel** (`Client::travel_to_place`; scripts' `travel_to`):
  a route is planned on the world terrain grid (the 24 m lattice of
  every landblock's heights, A* with 8 neighbours): an edge costs its
  length, more on a slope (`1 + 2 * grade`) and 0.7x on a road; a rise
  over run above 0.7 is a wall (the collision world's floors go up to
  1.33, the local graph's steps to 0.5); the sea is impassable and
  rivers and lakes are crossed in short spans at six times the cost
  (Dereth's bridges and fords are objects over water terrain that the
  grid cannot see, so the road leads to the crossing). The character
  walks the route leg by leg through the per-landblock move-to, which
  steers around buildings and fences; a leg that makes no progress for
  8 s is skipped. Terrain only: portals, the Town Network and recalls
  are not used yet.
* **Day and night.** The server's clock arrives in the TimeSync field of
  the packets it sends; the region file says when the world's clock
  started and how long a day lasts (about an hour of real time), so the
  client knows the time of day (`ac_client::daytime`). The sky, sun and
  fog follow it outdoors, and scripts read `me().time`,
  `time_of_day` ("Foredawn"), `day_fraction` and `night`.
* **The map (M)** is drawn from the game data, not a stored picture: the
  world map colours every landblock's 9x9 terrain vertices by the
  region's terrain type with hill shading (`ac-scene` `worldgrid` and
  `worldmap`, cached under `~/.cache/acswarm`), a local map or a
  dungeon floor plan comes from the landblock's terrain and collision
  floors (`localmap`; storeys are shown one at a time, the character's
  z ± 6 m), and everything the server has sent for the landblock is a
  dot by kind (player, NPC, monster, corpse, portal, door, item) with a
  searchable list. The gazetteer of towns (`ac_world::towns`) labels the
  world map and names travel destinations.
* **Travelling uses portals.** A journey is planned over the portals of
  the world as well as the ground (`ac_world::trip`): from Holtburg to
  Arwic that is the Town Network, in through the town's portal and out
  of the hub's, which takes about a minute instead of a quarter of an
  hour on foot. Walking between two spots is priced by the straight line
  between them, which is enough to choose which portals to take; the
  exact path of each step is planned when it is walked, on the terrain
  grid outdoors and on the landblock's own navigation graph indoors (a
  landblock's cells can lie outside its square, so an indoor leg is
  aimed in the character's own landblock, not the one its world position
  falls in). Using something in the world, attacking or taking the
  controls stops the journey, since the server walks the character to
  whatever they used.
* **Planning happens on the frame the player asks**, so it has to be
  cheap. Checking every portal of a plan against the terrain router meant
  a search over the world for each, and the client stopped answering
  while it thought; only the first is checked now, and a step that turns
  out not to be walkable plans the way again when it is reached. A
  replan never carries on inside the same call either: the new plan is
  walked from the next frame, so nothing can go round for ever.
* **Being carried off is normal.** A portal takes whoever touches it, so
  the character walks at a portal's centre and can be swept away
  mid-stride by one the journey never meant to use. Rather than only
  keeping clear of them, a journey notices it has landed somewhere it
  did not plan and plans again from there. A few portals sit above the
  ground and are jumped into, so one that has not taken the character
  three seconds after they reached it gets a jump.
* **How a journey is chosen** is a preference (`ac_world::trip::Prefs`):
  `quick` takes the fastest chain of portals, `steady` reckons a portal
  at six times the cost and takes at most three, since every hop is a
  chance to be turned away or land somewhere unexpected. Scripts set it
  with `travel_style("steady")`.
* **A portal takes whoever walks into it.** A route on the way to
  somewhere else must give every other portal a wide berth, or the
  character is swallowed by one and comes out across the world: a walk
  through Sanamar kept ending in Holtburg. The overland router charges
  twelve times the cost within fourteen metres of a portal it is not
  meant to take (`worldroute::find_avoiding`). For the same reason a
  portal step is finished only when the character is where that portal
  comes out; merely being in another landblock is not enough, since
  walking to a portal usually crosses a boundary, and counting that as
  having gone through skipped the rest of the journey.
* **Portals ask things of you.** Many have a level range and some want a
  quest finished (`min_level`, `max_level`, `quest` in the portal table).
  A journey is planned only over the ones the character may take, and a
  portal that has not swallowed the character twelve seconds after they
  reached its mouth is treated as one that will not: it is left out and
  the rest of the way is planned again. That is what made a trip stop
  and stand still.
* **Portals and landmarks are server data**, not in the client's own
  files: `crates/ac-world/data/portals.csv` and `landmarks.csv` are
  copies of where every portal, lifestone, vendor and standing NPC is
  (`reference/scripts/data/*.sh` regenerate them).
* **Lifestones** attune on Use (half stamina). `/lifestone` recalls.
  Portal magic (item school) ties one primary and one secondary portal
  and one lifestone, recalls to them and can summon a portal.
* Town Network, recall gems, housing recall (`/house`, allegiance
  mansion recall for monarch-owned villas and mansions) and "portal
  storms" (moved out of crowded areas; status icons 0x02C9..0x02CC).

## 9. Housing

* Apartments (level 20; 100,000 pyreals + a Writ of Refuge, maintenance
  10,000 pyreals a period), cottages (level 20; the cheap ones 300,000
  pyreals + Writ of Refuge + Iron Heart, maintenance 30,000), villas
  (level 35) and mansions (rank 6 monarch), with hooks for items and
  storage chests. The sign in front (ACE `SlumLord`, named after the
  house type) is what you use: Use on it answers HouseProfile 0x021D
  (slumlord guid; dwelling id, owner guid and name, bitmask 1 active /
  2 requires monarch, min/max level and allegiance rank (-1 none),
  maintenance-free flag, type 1 cottage 2 villa 3 mansion 4 apartment,
  then the buy list and the rent list of (needed, paid, wcid, name,
  plural)).
* BuyHouse 0x021C (slumlord guid, count, item guids) pays with the
  listed stacks (larger stacks are split, the rest stays); the server
  checks level, monarch/rank, the 15-day account age (apartments exempt)
  and the 30-day cooldown since the last purchase, then says
  "Congratulations!  You now own this dwelling." and sends HouseData
  0x0225 (buy and rent timestamps, type, maintenance-free, buy and rent
  lists, position). HouseQuery 0x021E asks for it again; without a house
  the answer is HouseStatus 0x0226. RentHouse 0x0221 (same shape as buy)
  pays maintenance toward the outstanding amounts, from anyone, at a
  sign in the same landblock; UpdateRentTime 0x0227 / UpdateRentPayment
  0x0228 follow. AbandonHouse 0x021F ("You abandon your house!") boots
  everyone and answers HouseStatus.
* Guests: AddPermanentGuest 0x0245 / RemovePermanentGuest 0x0246 (name),
  ChangeStoragePermission 0x0249 (name, flag), SetOpenHouseStatus 0x0247
  (flag), ModifyAllegianceGuestPermission 0x0267 / StoragePermission
  0x0268 (flag), BootSpecificHouseGuest 0x024A (name), BootEveryone
  0x025F, RemoveAllPermanentGuests 0x025E, RemoveAllStoragePermission
  0x024C; the server answers each in chat ("Reborn has been added to
  your guest list.", "Your house is now open to the public.") and
  RequestFullGuestList 0x024D returns UpdateHAR 0x0257 (version
  0x10000002, bitmask 1 open / 2 allegiance / 4 allegiance storage,
  monarch guid, guest hash table of guid, storage flag, name, then the
  roommate guids). House objects carry a RestrictionDB in their
  WeenieDesc (flag 0x4000000: version, open, monarch, hash table of
  guid to permission), re-sent to nearby players as
  HouseUpdateRestrictions 0x0248 when it changes.
* **Hooks and storage**: both are containers (ItemType 0x200) standing
  in the house. Hooks carry one item: use the hook (it opens like a
  chest, empty) and PutItemInContainer (item, hook) hangs it; the server
  answers "The container is closed" (0x3EE) when the hook was not opened
  first, so the client opens a world container and stores once its
  contents arrive. A hooked item re-models the hook (UpdateObject with
  the item's setup and name, the item itself stays hidden inside);
  using the hook again shows the item as the hook's contents, and taking
  it puts it back in the pack. Storage chests open for the owner and
  guests with storage permission ("You do not have permission to access
  Storage" otherwise) and hold up to their capacity. Dropping a carried
  item onto a hook or chest in the world does the whole sequence; the
  script `put_in(item, container)` does too. Verified in the Holtburg
  apartment: dagger hooked and taken back, scarab stored and retrieved.
* `/house` (TeleToHouse 0x0262) recalls to the house, `/mansion`
  (0x0278) to the allegiance's; both refused while the Training Academy
  recall lock is set.
* Verified on ACE: the admin bought a Holtburg apartment at its sign
  (5 pyreal stacks and the writ consumed), read the house data, added
  Reborn as a guest with storage, opened the house, saw the sign show
  the owner and the paid price, and abandoned it. Rent payment was not
  exercised (the cooldown blocks a second purchase).

## 10. Options and UI state the server keeps

PlayerDescription carries, under option flags: character options 1 and
2 (bitfields such as auto-repeat attacks, show tooltips, side-by-side
vitals, use main pack as preferred, PK settings), shortcuts, the 8 spell
bars, desired components, spellbook filters, gameplay options blob
(0x200) and the timestamp format. SetSingleCharacterOption (0x0005) and
SetCharacterOptions (0x01A1) write them back. Titles: TitleSet (0x002C),
CharacterTitle / UpdateTitle events. AFK mode and message (0x000F/0x0010).

## 11. Training Academy

Every character ACE creates starts in the Training Academy, dungeon
landblock 0x8602 (`PlayerFactory.cs`: `Location` is the CharGen table's
`StarterAreas[town].Locations[0]`, which is the academy for every town;
the town only sets `Instantiation`, a fallback position). The academy
is a chain of small quests told through NPC emote scripts, and its exit
portal wants one of them stamped. A character that walks out of it
cannot come back. Sources: the ACE world database, tables
`landblock_instance` (what stands in 0x8602), `weenie_properties_emote`
and `_emote_action` (what the NPCs say and stamp), `weenie_properties_
create_list` (what the creatures drop) and `weenie_properties_string`
type 37 (a portal's QuestRestriction). The client's copy of the steps is
`crates/ac-world/data/academy.csv`; the rule that walks them is
`crates/ac-client/src/academy.rs`.

Coordinates below are landblock-local (the DB's `origin_x/y/z`); world
= `landblock_origin(0x8602) + local`. Cells 0x0100 and up are indoors.

**Recalls are off** for a character that has not left: `RecallsDisabled`
(PropertyBool 107) is set at creation and cleared by the exit portal.
Dying in the academy puts the character back at its spawn spot in the
first room (the Sanctuary is set to `Location` at creation, not to the
Life Stone standing in the outer courtyard), with nothing lost at level
1.

**The rooms and their tasks, in order:**

1. *First room* (cell 0x01AD, spawn at 12.3, -28.5). **Society Greeter**
   (wcid 30991). Use: "Hail and welcome to Dereth! ... drag the Calling
   Stone to me" while `CallingStoneGiven` is not stamped; give the
   Calling Stone (5084, in every new pack) → "Why don't you go talk to
   the Agent in the next room?" and the stamp. Nothing later needs it.
2. *Second room* (0x01B0/0x01B1), through a plain door (12705).
   **Jonathan** (29324): Use hands out an Exit Token (29335, stamps
   `AcademeyExitTokenGiven`, sic) and says "If you want to skip your
   training and leave the Academy early, give this token back to me."
   Giving it back runs `pick_coat_color` (one of the coats 13210..13219)
   then `finalize_exit`: the Sanctuary is set to Holtburg, the Exit
   Token quest erased, 11 000 XP awarded (`AwardNoShareXP`), a
   Pathwarden-style gift (49563) given and spell 3815 "Free Ride to
   Holtburg" cast, which teleports the character out. This is the
   short way out: the same rewards as the whole tutorial.
   **Samuel** (29322): Use asks `LeggingsAcademyPickUp`, then
   `CapAcademyPickUp`, then `GauntletsAcademyPickUp`; any one stamped
   → "You found some armor! ... You may now proceed to the Training
   Area"; none → "Looks like you need some armor! There are 3 different
   pieces of armor here." The pieces lie on the floor: Leather Gauntlets
   13240 at (18.4, -21.1), Leather Cap 13239 at (22.2, -40.2, 0.7),
   Leather Leggings 13241 at (17.8, -41.7); picking one up stamps its
   quest (a 10 s item generator puts them back). The "Training Area"
   door (29329, at 24.8, -30) is not locked.
3. *Training Area* (0x023A and the sparring rooms east of it, x 56..90,
   y -5..-35). **Training Master** (29320) at (56.1, -20.1). Use: "The
   signs will tell you how to retrieve the Academy Token. Bring that
   token back to me." (no quest check). Ten **Sparring Golems** (12698,
   level 1, 30 health, 10 s respawn) each drop an **Academy Token**
   (12709, 100%). Give it → "Excellent work! You have completed your
   combat training! You may now take the portal to the Central
   Courtyard", 1000 XP, stamp `AcademyTokenGiven`. The **Central
   Courtyard** portal (31061, at 70, -40) requires that stamp
   (refusal: WeenieError 0x0474 "You must complete quest to use
   portal") and drops the character at its linkspot (50, -54, 1).
4. *Central Courtyard*. **Academy Foreman** (30995) at (36.8, -73.7).
   Use: not `WaspWingDone` → "Carpenter Wasps have infested my
   woodpile! ... They are here through this door beside me. If you
   bring me one of their wings ..."; done → "You should go visit the
   Academy Blacksmith now". The door (4453) is at (34.5, -70); fourteen
   **Carpenter Wasps** (12704, level 2, 20 health) at x -3..13, y
   -60..-81 drop a **Carpenter Wasp Wing** (13089) 30% of the time. Give
   it → "Thank you! You are certainly doing your part ...", 2000 XP,
   stamp `WaspWingDone`.
   **Academy Blacksmith** (30996) at (37.9, -89.2). Use: not
   `BellowsNewbieTurnedIn` → "Perhaps you could help me with these
   thieving Thrungum ... stolen my bellows! ... running towards the
   vegetable gardens"; done → "You should visit the Academy
   Researcher". Fourteen **Thieving Thrungus** (29333, level 2, 10
   health) at x 26..52, y -115..-134 drop the **Bellows** (12710) 30% of
   the time. Give it → "My bellows! Thank you", 3000 XP, an **Academy
   Library Key** (30999) and the stamp.
   The **Academy Library** door (30998, at 64.7, -90) is locked to that
   key (`keydooracademya`, 9999 uses); behind it the **Academy
   Researcher** (30997) sells the Oil of Rendering (optional) and the
   stairs lead up (z 12) to the **Wordsmith** (a chat book), **Academy
   Crier** (tips), **Academy Shopkeep** and the **Senior Guard** (29318,
   at 82.4, -57.6, 12): "A hive of Olthoi just breached the walls of the
   Outer Courtyard ... Go through this portal, then talk to the Sentry."
   The **Outer Courtyard** portal (29334, at 90, -60, 11.9) has no
   restriction and lands at (119, -141).
5. *Outer Courtyard* (the hive, z 0 down to -12). **Sentry** (30994) at
   (123.7, -133). Use: "Find the Adolescent Olthoi and kill it. Bring
   back one of those orbs!" (no quest check on Use). A ramp at (124,
   -129) → (132, -135) drops from z 0 to -6 (too steep for the client's
   navigation graph but not for the character, which walks straight up
   it); eight **Young Olthoi** (29332, level 2, 35 health, 1 min
   respawn) guard the way down to z -12 through doors (4451) at
   (110, -165), (160, -195), (190, -225); the **Adolescent Olthoi**
   (29331, 35 health) stands at (153.4, -234.6, -12) and drops a
   **Protection Orb** (29336, 100%). Give it to the Sentry → "Thank
   you! You have done the Dereth Exploration Society a great service
   ... Use the portal to Holtburg. When you get there, seek out Flinrala
   Ryndmad.", a coat, 49563, 5000 XP and the stamp
   `SentryTaskComplete`. Tutorial chests (30989, potions) and a Life
   Stone (120, -160, -6) stand about.
6. **Exit to Holtburg** (29338, at 158.6, -149.5, -6.1) requires
   `SentryTaskComplete`. Its Portal emote erases every academy stamp
   (`AcademyTokenGiven`, `SentryTaskComplete`, the armour, wing, bellows
   and orb quests), sets the Sanctuary to Holtburg (0xA9B40019: 84, 7.1,
   94), clears `RecallsDisabled` and pops up "Congratulations! You have
   completed your training! Make sure you talk to Alcott to continue
   your journey." The portal's destination is the same Holtburg spot.
   On ACE the exit lands every character in Holtburg whatever town was
   chosen: the "Free Ride to <town>" spells (3813 Shoushi, 3814 Yaraq,
   3535 Sanamar, 3815 Holtburg) only set `Instantiation`, which the
   server uses when a character has no position at all, and the four
   exit portals (29337..29340) are placed nowhere but the Holtburg one.

**How the client does it** (`ac_client::academy`): a step machine over
the table, run by autoplay whenever the character stands in 0x8602 and
`Config::academy.enabled` (default on). By default
(`Config::academy.skip`) it takes Jonathan's way out: walk to his room,
use him, wait for the Academy Exit Token to land in the pack and for
him to finish speaking (a gift during his emote is refused with
WeenieError 0x4ce "AI refuse item during emote"), give it back, and
wait for the Free Ride. Seen live with a fresh Bow Hunter, 25 s from
placement to Holtburg:

    Jonathan tells you, "If you want to skip your training and leave the Academy early, give this token back to me."
    Jonathan gives you Academy Exit Token.
    Jonathan tells you, "But beware, once you leave the Training Academy, you cannot come back!"
    You give Jonathan Academy Exit Token.
    Jonathan gives you Oil of Rendering.  (twice)
    Jonathan gives you Academy Coat.
    Jonathan gives you Facility Hub Portal Gem.
    Jonathan teleports you with Free Ride to Holtburg.
    Make sure you talk to Alcott to continue your journey.
    You are now level 5!  You've earned 11,000 experience.

The character lands at 0xA9B30017 (Holtburg, 84 7.1 94) with the
skills raised by the level. With `skip` off, or when Jonathan is not
to be found, the tasks are done one by one. Talk steps use the NPC and
listen: the "done" line skips the rest of the quest, so a character
back from a death (or a restarted client) re-asks its way to where it
was; a portal that works proves the quest before it. Hunts put the
weapon the character was made for in hand and point the ordinary fight
rule at the named creatures, then empty their corpses. Doors on the way
are opened; the library key is used on its door. Finished means the
character is in another landblock; the other rules then take over
(following, growing).

## What this means for acswarm

* **Spell bar ≠ components.** The spell bar panel shows the 8 bars from
  `Options::spell_bars`, lets the user add spells from the book (drag or
  double-click → AddSpellFavorite) and remove them (Delete →
  RemoveSpellFavorite), cycles bars and spells, and casts the selected
  spell with the number keys. It never shows components.
* **Components panel** is a separate view: every carried item whose
  weenie class is a spell component (the SpellComponentDIDs mapping
  0x27000002 maps component id → weenie class id), with counts and the
  desired quantity, plus a "fill from vendor" action that buys up to the
  desired counts while a mage vendor is open.
* **Casting flow in the client**: need a wielded caster → enter magic
  mode → pick spell → send Cast(Targeted|Untargeted)Spell → play the
  wind-up and cast gestures on our own model → handle HearSpeech spell
  words, the fizzle WeenieError, the "consumed components" chat and the
  stack decrements, mana update, and enchantment registry updates for
  buffs. Component availability can be pre-checked client side from the
  SpellTable formula, the foci in the pack (prismatic formula) and the
  inventory, to grey out spells the character cannot cast.
* **Spellbook panel**: known spells from PlayerDescription plus
  MagicUpdateSpell/MagicRemoveSpell, filtered by school and level with the
  server-side filter bits, sorted by DisplayOrder; details from SpellTable;
  delete sends RemoveSpellC2S.
* **Enchantment (buff) list** from the registry with remaining durations.
* **Character sheet**: unassigned XP, per-skill/attribute raise costs from
  the XpTable, train/specialize with credits, vitae indicator.
* Everything above is state on `ac_client::Client` (or `ac_world`) with
  plain methods, so plugins and scripts can drive it; the panels are just
  views. UI layout is free: it does not need to look like the 2016
  client, only to expose these mechanics correctly.
