//! The spells that move health, stamina and mana about.
//!
//! A caster does not wait for mana to come back on its own: it pours
//! stamina into mana with a transfer, and when the stamina runs low
//! refills it with Revitalize, which costs mana but gives back more
//! stamina than that mana made. Round and round; that is how a mage
//! keeps casting. Heal Self is the same kind of thing for health.
//!
//! Which spell does which is server data, so `data/spell_vitals.csv`
//! is a copy of it (see `reference/scripts/data/spell_vitals.sh`):
//! boosts, which restore a vital by an amount, and transfers, which
//! drain a share of one vital into another.
