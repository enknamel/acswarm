//! Planning a journey that uses portals as well as legs on foot: the
//! Town Network from a town to the hub and out again, a dungeon's
//! "Surface" portal, a town's own portal.
//!
//! The search works on positions, not on the landscape: walking between
//! two spots is priced by the straight line between them (with a detour
//! factor), which is enough to choose *which* portals to take. The exact
//! path of each leg on foot is planned by the caller when it walks it,
//! on the terrain grid or the landblock's own navigation graph.
//!
//! Only portals whose mouth can be walked to are considered, and a leg
//! on foot is only believed within [`WALK_REACH`]; the character cannot
//! walk between continents, so a trip across the sea has to be portals
//! all the way.
//!
//! A recall spell the character can cast (see [`Recall`] and
//! `crate::recalls`) is a hop from wherever it stands straight to the
//! spell's destination, costing only the cast. The caller says which
//! ones it can cast right now; the planner takes one when it beats the
//! walk or the portals, and a journey can go on from where it lands.
