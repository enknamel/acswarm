//! What to hit a creature with.
//!
//! Every creature takes more damage from some kinds of attack than
//! others, and the difference is large: an Ice Golem takes nothing at
//! all from cold and full damage from fire, and a Frost Golem is barely
//! scratched by a pierce weapon. The figures are per creature and per
//! damage type, and they are server data, so `data/creatures.csv` is a
//! copy of them (see `reference/scripts/data/creatures.sh`).
//!
//! Creatures are keyed by their weenie class id, which the server puts
//! in every object description, so a creature in view is matched
//! exactly and never by guesswork. Names are kept as well, because the
//! rules a player writes are in names, and because a creature whose
//! weenie is not in this copy of the data can still often be recognised
//! by what it is called.
//!
//! Spells need the same treatment from the other side: the client's own
//! SpellTable does not say what a spell hits with, so
//! `data/spell_elements.csv` maps a spell id to its element, both for
//! the spells that deal it and for the ones that make a target take
//! more of it.
//!
//! Weapons carry an element too, and some are imbued to rend a
//! creature's resistance to it. A fire weapon against something weak to
//! fire is worth several times one that is not, so [`Imbue`](imbue) and
//! [`Element::rending`] are here as well, for the code that chooses
//! what to wield.
//!
//! Between the two, [`best_spell`] answers the question that matters
//! while fighting: of the spells I am willing to throw, which one hurts
//! this thing most?
//!
//! The same table also carries two figures about whether a creature is
//! worth fighting at all: its [`tolerance`], the server's flags for when
//! it will attack, and its level. A Rabbit and a Revenant both stand
//! there until they are hit; only the level tells them apart.
