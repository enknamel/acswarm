//! Coming back from a death.
//!
//! A character that dies wakes at its lifestone with its buffs purged, a
//! vitae penalty, and its best gear lying on a corpse where it fell.
//! Left to the other rules it would stand there, or worse, walk off to
//! hunt with nothing in its hands. This module is the rule that runs
//! first after "stay alive": it notices the death, waits out the
//! respawn, puts the buffs back, walks to the corpse, empties it, wields
//! what was wielded, and hands the character back to whatever it was
//! doing.
//!
//! The decisions live in [`Recovery`], a state machine fed a [`View`] of
//! the world each tick and answering with one [`Action`]; it touches no
//! client state, so the transitions are tested without a server. The
//! [`Client`] side gathers the view and carries out the action.
//!
//! Two things are given up on rather than waited for forever: a corpse
//! that cannot be reached within `Survive::corpse_minutes`, and one that
//! has killed the character again on the way back. Vitae is not waited
//! out (it wears off with experience, not time); instead, while it is
//! over `Survive::vitae_above` the fight rules leave the hard targets
//! and the killer alone (see [`Client::shy_of`]).
