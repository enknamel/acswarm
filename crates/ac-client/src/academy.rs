//! Getting a new character through the Training Academy.
//!
//! Every character ACE creates starts in the academy (landblock 0x8602)
//! and its exit portal wants the Sentry's quest done, so a character
//! played by the rules -- a follower made from the fleet panel, say --
//! would stand in the first room for ever. This rule runs whenever the
//! character is in that landblock: it walks the tutorial's steps
//! (`ac_world::academy`), talking to the agents, fighting what they ask
//! for, handing over what they want and walking into the portals, and
//! stops the moment the character is anywhere else.
//!
//! The decisions live in [`State`], a step machine fed a [`View`] of the
//! world each tick and answering with one [`Action`]; it touches no
//! client state, so the transitions are tested without a server. The
//! [`Client`] side gathers the view and carries the action out with the
//! ordinary means: a walk goal (`Client::follow`), `use_object`, `give`,
//! `pick_up`, and the fight rule pointed at the creatures a step names.
//!
//! What the agents say is the only word on the quests (the server keeps
//! the stamps to itself), so every talk listens: an agent's "already
//! done" line skips the rest of its quest, which is how a character
//! coming back from a death, or a restarted client, picks up where it
//! was. A portal that works is proof of the quest before it too.
