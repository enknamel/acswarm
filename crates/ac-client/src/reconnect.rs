//! Getting back in after a drop.
//!
//! A session can end three ways. The player quits, which is a clean
//! [`Client::disconnect`](crate::Client::disconnect) and the end of it. The server refuses us for a
//! reason waiting will not fix (banned, wrong password, a character that
//! is not ours), which is also the end of it. Or the connection dies:
//! the router hiccups, the server restarts, a packet storm eats the
//! session. That last one is worth recovering from, because leaving the
//! character standing in the world until the server's own timeout is
//! worse than being logged out, and because everything since the last
//! server-side save is rolled back when the character finally does drop.
//!
//! [`Reconnect`] is the rule for the third case: a state machine fed the
//! ending and the clock, answering with [`Action::Connect`] when it is
//! time to try again. It touches no client state and opens no sockets,
//! so the schedule, the attempt cap and the cooldown are tested without
//! a server. The caller (the viewer's session loop) does the connecting
//! and hands back what happened.
//!
//! The one subtlety is the login cooldown. A session that ends without a
//! clean disconnect leaves the account logged in server-side for a
//! minute or so; a retry inside that window is refused with
//! `CharacterError` 1 (`Logon`) rather than let in. Those refusals are
//! not the client's fault and do not spend an attempt: the machine waits
//! out [`Policy::cooldown`] and tries again, up to
//! [`Policy::cooldown_waits`] times.
