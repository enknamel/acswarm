//! What the team does between fights: the mode it is all in, and the
//! money it needs to get back on its feet.
//!
//! A party is in one of two modes at a time. It is **hunting**, or it
//! is **restocking**. The switch is not made by each character on its
//! own -- a mage that walks off to town alone leaves the archer with
//! nothing to hide behind -- so the mode is decided from what the whole
//! roster says about itself, and every session reaches the same answer
//! from the same roster. There is no vote and nothing to agree on.
//!
//! The trigger is deliberately early. Running a party until someone
//! fires their last arrow means the trip to town starts from a losing
//! fight; instead the party leaves for town while everyone still has
//! enough to fight their way out. That is what [`Restock::go_at`] is:
//! the fraction of a full load that sends the whole party shopping.
//! Coming back needs a higher bar, [`Restock::full_at`], so a party
//! cannot leave town and immediately decide to return.
//!
//! There are two shapes of trip. The party can all walk to town, which
//! is simple and slow; or it can send one character -- the
//! quartermaster -- with everyone's sale loot and everyone's shopping
//! list, and have it hand the goods back out on its return. The second
//! is much faster and keeps the party together at the hunting ground,
//! at the cost of needing one pack big enough for the lot.
//!
//! Money is a team matter too. Loot sells for pyreals, pyreals are
//! heavy and capped, and the useful form to carry is trade notes; and
//! the character that looted the good armour is not always the one that
//! needs to buy four hundred tapers. So after selling, whoever is over
//! their own bill hands the difference to whoever is under theirs.
