//! Keeping a character that plays on its own going for hours: the
//! rules of `crate::autoplay` fight, loot and buff, and these make sure
//! there is always something worth fighting, a pack to put the loot in,
//! and a character that grows with the experience it earns.
//!
//! Three rules, run when nothing more pressing is going on (see
//! [`Client::autoplay_grow`]):
//!
//! 1. **Spend experience.** The unassigned pool is spent a rank at a
//!    time, the way a player would: the skills it fights with first (the
//!    weapon in hand, the defences, the magic it casts), the attributes
//!    those skills are built from next, then the rest. Each candidate
//!    rank is priced from the XpTable and weighed by how much it matters,
//!    and the best value is bought; one rank at a time, no more often
//!    than the server can answer.
//! 2. **Go where the monsters are.** When nothing has been worth fighting
//!    for a while, a hunting ground that suits the character's level is
//!    picked from `ac_world::hunting` (the nearest, leaving out the one
//!    just hunted out and any that could not be reached) and travelled
//!    to. Fights on the way are fought; the journey is picked up again
//!    after each.
//! 3. **Run to town.** When the pack is full, or something the character
//!    lives on is short and cannot be made from what it carries
//!    (healing kits, arrows, spell components), it walks to the nearest
//!    vendor, sells the loot it has no use for, buys what it is short of,
//!    and goes back to its hunting ground. A run visits up to a few
//!    vendors of the same town, since no one shop buys everything or
//!    sells everything.
//!
//! What is sold is decided by searches in the inventory's own language,
//! the way loot is chosen (`Growth::sell`), with the things a character
//! cannot do without kept back whatever the searches say: what it
//! wears and wields, money, packs, components, ammunition, tools, the
//! items it keeps stocked, and weapons it could wield. A weapon it
//! cannot wield is loot.
