//! Everything a character might do, in the order it is considered.
//!
//! This was a chain of twenty `if this(now) { return }` lines. The
//! order was doing a great deal of work -- it silently settles a
//! hundred questions, such as whether a dying character heals or flees,
//! whether loot is taken before a leader is followed, whether the pack
//! is tidied before anything decides it is full -- and none of that was
//! readable, loggable or testable, because it was control flow.
//!
//! It is a table now. The same order, the same behaviour, but the order
//! is a thing the program has rather than a thing it is: a panel can
//! show it, the log can name the step that claimed a tick, and a test
//! can assert that healing comes before hunting.
//!
//! Two kinds of step, because they are not the same sort of thing (see
//! `docs/agent.md`):
//!
//! - [`Layer::Reflex`] is what must happen before anything is decided.
//!   A spell in the air, health at forty per cent. Fixed order, no
//!   scoring, and the cost is paid by every session on every tick.
//! - [`Layer::Goal`] is what the character does with its time when
//!   nothing is on fire. These are the ones whose fixed order will
//!   become utility scoring, and they are marked so that the change can
//!   be made to exactly them.
//!
//! [`Housekeeping`] is neither: a handful of things that run every tick
//! and never claim it.
