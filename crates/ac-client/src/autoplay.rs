//! Playing the character on its own: keeping it alive, keeping its buffs
//! up, fighting what it is told to fight and taking the loot worth
//! taking.
//!
//! This is a set of rules, not a script: [`Config`] says what to do and
//! [`Client::tick_autoplay`] does the highest-priority thing that needs
//! doing this moment. In order:
//!
//! 1. **Stay alive**: below a fraction of health, use a healing kit or
//!    cast a healing spell; below a lower fraction, break off the fight.
//! 2. **Urgent buffs**: one about to run out goes back up before
//!    anything but healing -- a fight, a corpse, a journey. A lapsed buff
//!    can kill a character outright; a fight or a corpse can wait a cast.
//! 3. **Loot**: a corpse of something we killed is opened, the items
//!    the rules say to take are taken, and it is closed again.
//! 4. **Salvage**: items the rules tagged for salvage are salvaged by
//!    the team's best salvager, and carried to it by everyone else.
//! 5. **Fight**: pick the nearest creature that passes the name rules
//!    and attack it, with the weapon that suits it best.
//! 6. **Top up buffs**: in a quiet moment, recast anything that has
//!    run out or will soon.
//!
//! Loot is judged by the character's loot profile and nothing else
//! (`crate::profile`): the first rule that claims an item decides it,
//! and items are appraised first when a rule needs numbers
//! ([`judge_loot`]). A character whose profile is missing takes
//! nothing, which is the right way round for a client with no rules to
//! read. The two name lists here -- `Loot::always` and `Loot::never` --
//! are the player's own word and are read before any rule.
//!
//! Everything a rule keeps, salvages or sells is picked up, and what it
//! was taken for is written down against its guid (`Autoplay::tag`,
//! `crate::profile::Ledger`) for the salvage pass, the run to town, the
//! UI and scripts.
//!
//! Nothing here talks to the UI: the panel edits a [`Config`] and reads
//! [`Autoplay::status`].
