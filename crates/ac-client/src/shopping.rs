//! The bridge between the character and the shopping rules.
//!
//! The deciding lives in `ac-vendor`, which knows nothing of sockets,
//! packs or physics: it is handed a description of the moment and
//! answers with one thing to do. This is the half that has to touch the
//! world -- reading the pack into that description, and carrying out
//! whatever comes back.
//!
//! Keeping the two apart is what lets a whole trip be watched at a desk
//! (`cargo run -p ac-vendor --example trip`) and in the autoplay panel,
//! with the same rules running in both.
