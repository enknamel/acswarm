//! Which buffs a character should be wearing, worked out from what it is
//! rather than written down by hand.
//!
//! The game is a closed system: the spells that exist, what each one
//! does, and the skills a character has trained are all known. So the
//! right set of buffs is not a matter of taste but of arithmetic, and a
//! player should not have to type it in. A character keeps up
//!
//! * every Life self-enchantment it knows: the protections, the
//!   regenerations, Armor Self;
//! * every Creature self-enchantment it knows that raises an attribute,
//!   a defence, or a skill it has trained or specialised, so a swordsman
//!   carries Heavy Weapon Mastery and not War Magic Mastery; of the
//!   weapon skills, only the one for the weapon in hand;
//! * the Item auras that suit the way it fights: damage, speed and
//!   accuracy for a weapon in hand, the caster's own for a wand;
//! * and the Item spells that harden what it wears, Impenetrability
//!   and the banes. Cast on the character itself, each of those lands
//!   on every enchantable piece worn and the shield at once, so it is
//!   one cast a spell rather than one a piece.
//!
//! Of each, the highest level it can actually land. Knowing a spell is
//! not the same as being able to cast it: every spell has a power, the
//! cast is rolled against the school's skill as it stands with every
//! buff counted, and a level too far above that skill fizzles more than
//! it lands. So the caller says which spells are castable well enough
//! and the highest of those is chosen. Levels come from the spell's
//! power in the client's own table, never from its name, and spells of
//! one category are one buff at different levels.
