//! The lobby: what the client shows between login and the world when it
//! is not auto-entering. [`select`] lists the account's characters
//! (Enter, Delete, Restore, New); [`create`] builds a new one from the
//! CharGen rules. [`Lobby`] holds both, turns their clicks into `Client`
//! calls, and follows the client's events (`Characters`, `Placed`,
//! `CharacterCreated`, `CharacterCreateFailed`). The host draws the 3D
//! preview of the character being created from [`Lobby::preview`].
//!
//! Both screens are the same shape as the panels (`view` / `draw` /
//! state) and have a demo mode with no session: `acswarm --demo-select`
//! and `--demo-create`.
