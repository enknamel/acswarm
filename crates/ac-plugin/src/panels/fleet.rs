//! The fleet (from the menu): every character being played, in this
//! process and in every other process on the bus, one row each, with
//! the controls a leader needs while playing one client by hand and
//! having the rest follow (see `docs/multi-session.md`, "Fleet view").
//!
//! The rows come from two places. This process's sessions are read
//! directly (`team::describe`, the same word the team plugin puts on
//! the bus), whether or not their team rules are on. Other processes'
//! sessions are heard on `autoplay.mate` (kept in a [`Roster`] of this
//! panel's own, so it does not depend on the team plugin's) and what
//! each is doing on `autoplay.event`. Experience an hour is worked out
//! here, from the totals seen over the last quarter of an hour.
//!
//! Controls on a session of this process act on it at once; on another
//! process's session they go out as a `fleet.request`, which the team
//! plugin over there applies (`team::Request`). A row of this process
//! is clickable to switch the window to it.
//!
//! The panel also starts the fleet. Its **Sessions** section is the
//! roster of accounts for the server being played, and it is the same
//! set of accounts the connect screen offers: both read and write the
//! login store (`crate::servers::Servers` in
//! [`crate::lobby::store`]'s file), so an account added or forgotten in
//! one shows in the other. The account, its password and the character
//! to enter with are the login store's; what the fleet adds is an
//! [`Entry`] per (server, account) with the [`Role`] and what to create
//! when the account lacks the character ([`CreateSpec`]: template,
//! heritage, sex, town), kept in the settings under [`ENTRIES_KEY`].
//! [`roster`] puts the two together into the [`SessionSpec`]s the rows
//! stand for.
//!
//! Start asks the host for a session (`Ctx::start_session`); once its
//! character stands in the world the role is applied ([`apply_role`]):
//! a follower gets team, follow and autoplay on, the leader team and
//! lead. "I lead" does the same for the session being played and
//! remembers its account for that server ([`LEADS_KEY`]) for the next
//! launch. A script or the command line drives the same path through
//! the blackboard keys [`START_KEY`] and [`STOP_KEY`].
//!
//! An older build kept one global roster of accounts under
//! [`ROSTER_KEY`] with no server against it. [`migrate`] folds that into
//! the login store once, on the first launch that knows a server.
