//! Loot profiles (bindable from the menu): the shelf of rule sets every
//! character in the process reads, and an editor for the one open.
//!
//! A profile is an ordered list of rules, and a rule is a name, what to
//! do with what it claims, and conditions that must all hold (see
//! `ac_client::profile`). The first rule that claims an item decides
//! it, so the order of the list *is* the policy and most of the panel
//! is about reading and reordering it.
//!
//! Three things the panel takes trouble over.
//!
//! * **Every change is saved as it is made.** There is no Apply button:
//!   a rule switched off here is off for the eleven other characters
//!   working the same ground before the next corpse is opened, which is
//!   what [`Library::put`] does.
//! * **What costs a round trip is marked.** Half of what a rule can ask
//!   needs the server to identify the item first, which is a message
//!   per item on every corpse. A rule or condition that needs one
//!   carries an `id` marker, so a profile can be tuned until it decides
//!   most items without asking anything.
//! * **A rule can be tried before it is trusted.** The list at the
//!   bottom judges what the character is carrying right now by the
//!   profile open, so the verdicts are read here rather than guessed at
//!   over a corpse.
//!
//! Sharing a profile is sending a file. They all live in one folder,
//! named at the top with a button that opens it in the file manager and
//! another that reads it again, so a profile from a friend is dropped
//! in and reloaded.
