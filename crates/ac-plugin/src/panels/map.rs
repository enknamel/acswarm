//! Map (bindable from the menu): the world map of Dereth or the current landblock (a
//! dungeon's floor plan indoors), with the character, everything the
//! server has sent for the landblock (players, NPCs, monsters, items,
//! portals, doors) as dots, and the overland route being walked.
//!
//! * Tabs switch between World and Local. Drag pans, the wheel zooms,
//!   "follow" keeps the character centred. Hovering shows the map
//!   coordinates under the pointer.
//! * The list on the right is what is worth walking to: people, ways
//!   out, anything that can be picked up and anything fixed that can be
//!   used (a lifestone, a forge, a chest, a door). The scenery the
//!   server also places, fixed and lifeless, is left out. A search box
//!   and kind chips narrow it, a click selects the object (and rings it
//!   on the map), a double-click uses it. The same search also looks
//!   through the whole world: its towns, the lifestones, shops and
//!   named folk of the gazetteer (`ac_world::landmarks`), and the mouth
//!   of every portal standing out in the open (`ac_world::portals`).
//!   Portals matter most of the three -- almost every dungeon in Dereth
//!   is a name on a portal and nothing else on the map -- and one
//!   answer is given per name, because fifty-three lines reading
//!   "Portal to Town Network" are no answer at all. They appear under
//!   "elsewhere in the world" with how far away they are, and a click
//!   travels there. A lifestone, a shop or a person is gone to where it
//!   really stands, upstairs if that is where, and a person is spoken to
//!   on arriving (see `ac_client::visit`).
//! * "spawns" marks what spawns where (`ac_world::spawns`): on the world
//!   map each hunting ground with its levels, on the local map each cell
//!   with generators, and in a dungeon each room of the storey shown.
//!   Marks are coloured by how hard the hardest creature there is for the
//!   character (grey, green, orange, red) and hovering one lists what it
//!   makes, with levels.
//! * "draw area" draws a hunting area (`ac_client::hunt`): outdoors click
//!   its corners on the map (a right-click takes the last away); in a
//!   dungeon click the rooms to hunt, or pick none for the whole dungeon.
//!   Name it and save it. Saved areas are listed and drawn -- outlines on
//!   the map, rooms shaded on the dungeon's floor plan -- and kept under
//!   `hunt.areas`.
//! * On the world map a double-click asks for a route there and the
//!   character walks it (see `ac_client::Client::travel_to`); a place
//!   name typed into "travel to" does the same by the gazetteer. The
//!   route is drawn as a line; Cancel stops it.
//!
//! The world map is rendered once from the terrain grid on a background
//! thread (the first time takes a few seconds while the grid is read
//! from the cell archive; both are cached under `~/.cache/acswarm`).
//! The local map covers the landblocks around the character, seven
//! across by default and up to eleven, and is drawn on a background
//! thread when the character moves to another landblock (or, in a
//! dungeon, another storey). Beyond the block they stand in only things
//! a few metres across are drawn, so towns and walls show through
//! instead of a thicket of trees. Forty-nine landblocks take about a
//! tenth of a second and thirty megabytes of pixels.
