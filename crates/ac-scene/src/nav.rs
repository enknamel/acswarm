//! Navigation for one landblock: walkable points sampled on a grid over
//! the static collision (and the terrain outdoors), joined where a
//! capsule can walk between them, searched with A*.
//!
//! The graph is built lazily and cached by whoever owns the collision
//! world (the client's `Player`). Nodes are feet positions on a floor,
//! snapped away from walls the way the walking code pushes a capsule
//! out; a column of the grid holds one node per level, so stacked
//! dungeon floors do not merge. Edges are directed (a ledge you can walk
//! off is not one you can climb) and validated by sampling the capsule
//! every half metre along the segment: floor continuity within the
//! capsule's step limits, no wall contact, head room, and a clear ray at
//! chest height; indoors, a hop that fails that but that the body's own
//! step walks is an edge too (`Ground::joins`). `find_path` runs A* between the nodes nearest the two
//! endpoints and then string-pulls the result with the same edge check,
//! so every consecutive pair of waypoints is walkable in a straight line.
