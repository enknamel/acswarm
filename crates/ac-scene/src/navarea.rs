//! Navigation over a neighbourhood of landblocks.
//!
//! [`crate::nav::NavGraph`] works on any rectangle, but the client has
//! so far only ever given it one landblock, which is why a character
//! walking towards a goal in the next block would run at a city wall:
//! the only route around it goes through a gate the single-block graph
//! could not see past. An [`Area`] assembles several neighbouring
//! blocks into one collision world with one terrain function over all
//! of them, so a path can leave the block it started in and come back.
//!
//! Areas are meant to be built off the frame thread: assembling nine
//! blocks costs tens of milliseconds and a long search across them
//! costs a hundred more. The graph fills in chunk by chunk as searches
//! reach it, so a second path through the same streets is much cheaper
//! than the first.
