//! Choosing what to fight something with.
//!
//! A character carrying several weapons should not swing whichever it
//! picked up last. Creatures take far more damage from some elements
//! than others, and a weapon that deals the right one, or that has been
//! imbued to rend the target's resistance to it, is worth several times
//! one that has not: a fire weapon against something that takes 1.4
//! times from fire and 0.5 from slashing is nearly three times the
//! weapon before its own damage is counted.
//!
//! None of that matters for a weapon the character cannot pick up. The
//! better a weapon is, the more it asks of whoever wields it --- the top
//! wands want a base War Magic of 275 --- and the server simply refuses
//! to arm anyone who falls short. So a [`Wielder`] is weighed against
//! every requirement first, and what the character is actually skilled
//! at then counts towards the score: a great sword swung at a hundred
//! skill is worth less than a wand cast at four hundred, whatever their
//! elements.
//!
//! [`score`] puts a number on a weapon against a particular creature and
//! [`best`] picks from what is carried. The numbers are a judgement, not
//! the game's own formula: they rank weapons against each other and
//! nothing more, and they only use what an appraisal has told us, so an
//! unappraised weapon is scored on what little its description carries.
