//! Loot profiles: what to pick up, and what to sell.
//!
//! A profile is an ordered list of rules; the first whose every
//! condition holds decides what happens to an item, and an item no rule
//! matches is left alone. That is the shape players already work in,
//! and it is the shape an editor can show honestly: a rule is a name, a
//! disposition, and a list of things that must all be true.
//!
//! Two things a rule can ask about.
//!
//! The item, which is the obvious half: its name, kind, worth,
//! workmanship, armour, the spells on it. And **the character**, which
//! is the half that makes a profile worth sharing. One profile is
//! handed to a whole group and each member reads it differently: the
//! one with the lockpick skill picks up the broken keys that only
//! lockpicking can mend, and nobody else carries them home. Without
//! that, a group needs a profile per character and no profile can be
//! passed to a friend.
//!
//! Profiles are files ([`Profile::save`]), one JSON document each, so
//! that sharing one is sending a file.
//!
//! # Deciding without an appraisal
//!
//! Half of what a rule can ask needs the server to be asked about the
//! item first, and that costs a round trip per item on every corpse.
//! So the rules are read in order and the walk stops at the first rule
//! that *could* match but cannot be judged yet ([`Verdict::NeedsId`]).
//! A profile whose early rules ask only about the cheap fields decides
//! most items without asking the server anything, which is the whole
//! reason players tune profiles this way.
