//! The script-facing API: the [`Api`] trait the host implements over
//! `ac_plugin::Ctx` (and tests implement with a recorder), and the Rhai
//! functions that forward to it.
//!
//! # Why a thread-local pointer
//!
//! Rhai native functions are `'static` closures: they cannot capture the
//! `&mut Ctx` a plugin callback receives, which lives only for that call.
//! Building a fresh engine (and re-registering every function) per call
//! would work but costs milliseconds per frame per session. So instead,
//! for the duration of each script call, [`Bound`] stores a raw pointer to
//! the current `Api` in a thread-local, and every registered function
//! reaches it through [`with_api`]. That accessor is the only place the
//! pointer is dereferenced, and it is safe to call at any time:
//!
//! * outside a bound call the pointer is `None` and the script gets an
//!   error instead of a dangling dereference (`Bound`'s `Drop` clears it
//!   before the borrow it was made from ends, and `Bound` carries that
//!   borrow's lifetime, so the host cannot touch the `Api` while scripts
//!   can);
//! * a `BUSY` flag rejects re-entrant access, so two `&mut dyn Api` never
//!   coexist. Functions that call back into the script (`with_session`)
//!   release the borrow before they do;
//! * the engine is single-threaded (`sync` off) and the pointer is
//!   thread-local, so no other thread can observe it.
